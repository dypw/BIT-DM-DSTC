I heard even 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars!", "I believe that. Bowling was a big sport back in the day.

I still love the game, but the clock watching gets annoying.", "Yep I agree with that. Do you watch any fantasy movies. Or do you do fantasy football at all"], ["Maybe so. I hope the data they are collecting in the field though can somehow be used to make the game a little bit safer", "Amazing that a game which averages just over 10 minutes of actual gameplay can be so damaging to players.", "Great point.

Do you know anything about the FIFA World Cup?", "I don't know much about it. When the US competed in the first FIFA world cup in 1930, they got 3rd place.", "Yes they did.

They must have kept the laws from way back in time lol", "Lots of curious things that are fun to learn about. It has been great chatting with you. Thanks!"], ["Yeah that's for sure. I really thought that players earned alot more money though.", "Maybe the MVP but an engineer will earn more money than the NFL player, I think soccer players are paid better", "Crazy to think that one team scored 222 points in a game once too."], ["that is crazy, I bet NFL makes more money now by a long shot, it was nice chatting with you!", "Yeah that is true, things have really changed. Same here.", "Good bye!"], ["Do you know if they have female players?", "Well, not in the NFL they dont but i'm sure they might have a womans league", "Did you know that the nfl has no rules against women?

I've tried watching football on TV but it seems to go on forever, and is mostly replays of what has happened already.", "Yeah the average NFL game has 11 minutes of live gameplay, what do you think they could do to improve it ?", "Less commercials. I think it is mainly a cultural thing. If I grew up here my opinion might be different."], ["The third was JFK.", "I see. I wonder how rich president banana of Zimbabwe is haha.

Usually about the Superbowl. What about you?", "I usually watch some games because my son really likes to watch football games."], ["I love Tom Hanks. I found it curious how the Lord of the Rings movies had huge losses despite being a success", "Wow, that's pretty surprising. Never know what's going to bring in the money huh?

And John Carter was a flop over here but broke box office records in Russia"], ["Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.", "Yes I do but not like ballet dancers. They can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.", "That is shocking. I used to date a ballet dancer actually. And I can confirm that they always have feet problems"], ["True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now.", "I find that pretty interesting!!

I wouldnt mind hearing those.", "I wonder what they sound like? What if it is actually aliens trying to talk with us?"], ["smart kid, took lots of ap tests in high school", "wow amazing. Brad Johnson is the only QB that threw himself a touchdown pass", "I did not even know such a thing is possible at all"], ["Me too. But I'm not sure what frequency it is. Kind of has me worried now!", "well maybe we will find out at some point. did you know we can grow a rib in 2-3 months", "No, that is shocking. How do they know that?"], ["No but I bet it's wild to see. Ha! Wonder if players are allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms while it's in play unlike regular soccer?", "Yeah I don't know it sounds more interesting to me than regular soccer though LOL, have you heard of the German player Mesut Ozil?", "I admire him because he donated his entire world cup bonus to pay for the surgeries of 23 different kids over in Brazil. I wish all athletes were like him!"], ["He was a very funny and interesting man. Something else that is funny is the University of Iowa painted the visiting locker room pink. I wonder what the visiting football teams thought about that.", "Yeah it was probably before pink became popular for professional football players to support breast cancer", "Do you watch a lot of football?"], ["Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went", "Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early"], ["Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive. I heard she was really good in that movie as well.", "It's funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder woman.

I figured that Tom Brady gave a biblical whooping to the Browns. Oh well. 222-0? Did Cumberland play with their cheerleaders or what?", "Hahah good point, I have no idea but what a defeat. Do you ever watch the ESPN?"], ["I do but i don't get the chance as much anymore. The patriots are on a role.", "Do you know how many teams are on the NFL?", "Wow that's a good question, how many?"], ["That is true. They produced a knock off lego once", "Wow, they have tried their hand on everything it seems, smart business people", "Very true. And they also own the Seattle Mariners. Good investment seems"], ["I'm surprised a building of that size has lasted so long", "I have no idea, but I am glad it survived. History should not be destroyed. Going back to football, the games apparently last only 11 minutes of active game", "I guess the players have other things to attend to. They are pretty busy. Sunday is a work day for them. I hope they are editing the Bible like that Jefferson fellow."], ["Yeah it cost a whooping $60 million, that is very expensive", "Yeah do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?", "Oh yeah the man is a legend, never fumbled the ball"], ["That makes sense. The NFL is using tracking chips on the players now.", "Yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others", "Yeah. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?"], ["Yes I have, very funny movie. That was a classic right there. Thanks", "I have never seen it before, I think Bill Murray said it was comedy gold or something like that.", "I agree. Did you know that some of the very first silent movies out there were comedies?"], ["Yeah, wasn't he the guy who didn't ever fumble the ball? Thats a pretty incredible feat.", "That sure is, what a career. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "That is surprising, I never saw bowling as that popular. But engineers make more over a lifetime than football players. So there is some incentive to work hard in school."], ["Where did you usually commute from and to? Technology and innovations fly by year after year.", "I simply drove to the big city for about an hour and a half. Did you ever use the car radio?", "That sounds like my commute.

I think that many fans would follow.", "See I like that idea haha. Maybe they could make a lot of money so that Trump could be back into the top three richest presidents of all time"], ["I do too. The Saints should do better, if not for themselves, but for the good of the league.", "Yeah I agree with you on that. Do you know what the average actual time of gameplay is for an average NFL game?", "Something like 10 minutes, right? I think I heard that when they were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads of the players."], ["I hope so too. We need engineers more than we need athletes if we're going to have a good society.", "True! Although it is pretty cool that there isn't a rule that keeps women from playing. All they need to do it meet eligibility", "I guess in the future we might see a woman. Anyway, great chat! Have a great evening!"], ["I don't know honestly. We have some teams that have won state championships in the area but i don't ever go to the games.", "I would think it would be more interesting if you went to the actual school.", "I would think so too but there's a school in Allen, Texas that spent 60 million dollars to build a football stadium to seat 18,000 people."], ["Yep, that's how consistently good they have been. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are eating somewhere and an NFL player comes in, they have", "Thats rude. I wonder why?", "They probably don't want any PR problems from that. It's kind of weird that there is no women in the NFL. There is no written rules against female players."], ["Really, Id be interested to read it. It does sound a little extreme at some times.", "I agree lol, do you have a favorite team?", "I do, unfortunately I root for the Dolphins, it was a family thing."], ["I do not think I have heard of that, what is it? There is a radio station that turns solar energy into sounds", "WOw cool one. Have you ever listened to canadian radios?", "I have not actually, I just do not have the time I guess. Back to football, Kellan Moore is the only half handed QB in the NFL."], ["Good point. The ESPN once won an Emmy. Do you know what for?", "Hmm I do not know that, did not know they could qualify for any of those awards", "Yeah, well they got it for the superimposed yellow like"], ["Yes, I did, interesting. I think they owned alot of land.", "I believe so too. Up until 1805 the vice president was decided by who the runner up was in the presidential election. Interesting because there probably would have been 2 different opinions on issues of the time in the White", "Yes, that is interesting. Its good times have changed."], ["Yeah and after words maybe on a subconscious level. You know the highest scoring game of all time?", "Yeah it was 222-0. What a blow out!", "Yeah Georgia Tech was not playing around. I would have hated to be on the bus ride home to Cumberland."], ["Im doing great. How bout you.", "I'm good, thanks for asking. Do you like Tennis?", "I have never really sat down to watch it to be honest."], ["I love the NFL! I try to follow all 32 teams the best I can.", "Nice. I did not know the game season is 17 weeks. That is a long time and lots of games", "Yes. It seems to go fast. Each team plays a 16 game schedule."], ["It That is an interesting coincidence.", "Did you know the NFL has no rules against women playing?", "That's great! There should a team entirely of women!"], ["Hello, do you like television?", "I do. I love watching SNL - especially the weekend update.", "I love SNL. Did you know when South Park aired the Family Guy episode, they received flowers from the Simpsons crew?"], ["Yes but I guess that was because bowling was much more popular back then", "I guess so. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", "Yes that is 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland"], ["I think soccer players make less money than a basketball player. But as a whole soccer is watched by a lot of people more in comparison to basketball. That is just my opinion", "Yea basketball players are making upwards of 50 million a year thats crazy. I know overseas soccer is a huge sport. In There exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time.", "I never heard of such thing. How 3 teams can play on the field at the same time is a mind blowing. Hahaha"], ["Well the NFL tracks everything. They even have chips in shoulder pads and footballs for tracking so I am pretty sure they are accurate.", "I think its great that tech is being integrated into the game, cool stats indeed they should make devices to control the brain damage injuries", "You would think that an average NFL player who will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime would want to help their own health. The NFL is violent."], ["Are you a baseball fan? I'm not, so I am not surprised that the Women's World cup has higher ratings than the World Series.", "Soccer is the international sport.

I am not a fan of the Patriots either! lol I did know about the rule allowing female players. I'm surprised no females play tho"], ["That must be a nightmare for opposing teams! Wonder if that would have helped Cumberland when Georgia Tech set the highest score record when they beat them 222-0. Ha!", "Haha that is true! It's so surprising that an average engineer will make more in his life than an NFL or MLB player", "Agreed. I even wonder if engineers made more than the top bowlers of the 1960s since they actually made more than the top football players as well!"], ["Yeah, no kidding. Although the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetime earning of an NFL player.", "Plus fewer concussions too.

It's probably the best bit of TV Sci-Fi since 1997.", "Yes I thought so too", "It's been nice chatting with you, but I'd better get back to work."], ["Well I hope the players get their degrees before going to the NFL.

Does that mean the cheerleader has to immediately stop eating and leave?"], ["I didn't, but that makes sense. I think they got an Emmy for it! Aren't the Emmy's for TV shows? That's so weird.", "To them it is still a show I guess. In 1916 georgia tech won 222 to zero", "What?! That's crazy.

Did you know NFL is sing tracking chips on the players now?", "The NFL is singing tracking chips? I did not know that."], ["Yeah the really sexist rule? it sounds really unfair, that rule should be banned and the cheerleaders should sue the team for that", "I think so too. The worst part in my opinion is the fact that they have to leave mid meal if players walk in", "Thats a terrible rule, I hope they change it in the near future, its humiliating actually,"], ["Yeah, same here. Roosevelt and Quincy did not believe in it much either so they did not use it when they swore in", "I don't think it should ever be used. How about you?", "Yeah I agree, religion is a preference.

I will research why"], ["Yeah I guess the career of a football player does not last that long so they do not have much time to make money", "True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now."], ["Hello!

I still love the game, but the clock watching gets annoying.", "Yep I agree with that. Do you watch any fantasy movies. Or do you do fantasy football at all"], ["Maybe so. I hope the data they are collecting in the field though can somehow be used to make the game a little bit safer", "Amazing that a game which averages just over 10 minutes of actual gameplay can be so damaging to players.", "Great point.

That is true but you usually only hear about a select few."], ["yep, and pokemon cards that are worth some money. How about that 70s show, ever seen that?", "no, i didnt but i think it was a very popular show. probably a lot of actors launched big careers there.", "You're right, mostly all of them became something big after that. I wish the same was for that 70s show uk remake, they only lasted 10 episodes."], ["Yes I did Snoop Dogg wrote a song for his son's football team once", "Wow nice. Bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "I guess it was a more popular sport back in the day"], ["It's a shame what happened to Andy Dalton", "Yes, his thumb injury put him out for the rest of the season.", "He was having one of his best seasons so far"], ["Yeah I do.

I can't see how soldiers in WW I could make a radio out of razor blades and pencils? Wow.", "lol, that takes pure science around that. I can't even get my already made radio to work!", "Ha. I would just end up cutting myself. I guess they may have tuned into Jupiter, there probably weren't a lot of station then."], ["The times were different then. Many people bowled and I guess they watched it on TV.", "NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads.", "I believe it. Probably helps with strategy and maybe player safety.

Kanye once did a snl skit mocking himself for interrupting award shows!", "I'm not a huge fan of Kanye music."], ["Oh that is so nice and convenient and free", "Yeah it is. DO you know why Michael Caine became an actor?", "I have no idea, how?

That must have hurt."], ["Yeah I think so too. Gal Gadot who is the new wonder woman, actually served two years as a soldier.", "Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive. I heard she was really good in that movie as well.", "It's funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder woman.

Engineers make more than football players over their lifetime"], ["That kind of sucks, tickets tend to be really expensive and the game lasts for 3 hours, you would expect more than just 11 minutes of gameplay, really unfair.", "Yeah I know. Bowlers used to make more in the 60s than football players", "They did? I wonder what changed, bowling used to be really popular back in the day, it doesnt seem like a really popular sport now"], ["I know, honestly if it's a sport played with feet and a ball then i guess they have the right to call it that.", "That is true. In Hungary \"football\" is soccer.", "In parts of Africa too. in Australia Rugby is football."], ["Yup, that is why I do not go to these events.", "Well, obviously everyone else at the concert seemed to enjoy it so not to bad of a deal", "Are there any concerts coming up that sound fun?"], ["Yeah i'm sure your right. Can you believe top bowlers made more than top nfl players in the 60's?", "Did they really? That's shocking, I wonder why, maybe people didn't care about football as much back then. Also I'm sure bowling games have more than 11 minutes of game play.", "That's unbelievable. Almost as much as espn winning an Emmy. do you know what for?"], ["It was a nice way to spend an afternoon. i try to watch the playoffs and the superbowl. this year i didnt.", "I watched the superbowl. I thought it was terrible, but that may just be me. So boring this year.", "I think it was probably better the year before. there was a big comeback. this year it was a defensive battle. i wanted the underdog to win. too bad."], ["Hi there, do you watch the NFL?", "Yes I like to watch NFL games, I try to watch as many games as I can, what about you?", "Nice, yes me too. Did you know women can play too?"], ["That is pretty impressive, that is probably part of why the Patriots have been one of the most dominant teams recently.", "Yes - the Patriots at least made a better decision than his high school - since they let tom Brady play!", "I bet they are really regretting that decision now."], ["And their feet look all weird for some reason", "Well putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes will absorb the odor.", "That is something I have to try tonight"], ["Hi, do you like football?", "Soccer or American football, i like them both.", "I like them both too, I did not realize that the season lasts 17 weeks"], ["Yes that is true and I am glad they came up with that line because it makes watching the game much easier", "Definitely. Can you believe the former Patriots running back never fumbled the football his entire career?", "That is so amazing. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?"], ["Hello, Do you enjoy football?", "I do love football! How about you?", "Yes, I love to go to the games? What do you think of the Patriots?"], ["I meant breast cancer, lol!

Did you know also the saints cheerleaders need to leave a restaurant if the players come in, kind of sexist!"], ["Yes it was. Do you know anything about the FIFA World Cup?", "I don't know much about it. When the US competed in the first FIFA world cup in 1930, they got 3rd place.", "Yes they did.

They must have kept the laws from way back in time lol", "Lots of curious things that are fun to learn about. It has been great chatting with you. Thanks!"], ["Yeah that's for sure. I really thought that players earned alot more money though.", "Maybe the MVP but an engineer will earn more money than the NFL player, I think soccer players are paid better", "Crazy to think that one team scored 222 points in a game once too."], ["that is crazy, I bet NFL makes more money now by a long shot, it was nice chatting with you!", "Yeah that is true, things have really changed. Same here.", "Good bye!"], ["Do you know if they have female players?", "Well, not in the NFL they dont but i'm sure they might have a womans league", "Did you know that the nfl has no rules against women? They could legally play if they met the requirements. What do you think?"], ["I would think so. Btw, nice chatting with you. Happy holiday", "Merry Christmas to you, and I'll leave you with this fun fact: The university of Iowa's locker room provided for visiting football players is completely painted pink!", "Thank you."], ["Hi friend, do you watch the NFL?", "Hey, I am a big fan of the NFL. How about you?", "I love watching the NFL, it may be my new religion. Did you know that Tom Brady has a book called the athletes bible?"], ["I'm originally from England so soccer is my thing, yes, a little rugby too. I've tried watching football on TV but it seems to go on forever, and is mostly replays of what has happened already.", "Yeah the average NFL game has 11 minutes of live gameplay, what do you think they could do to improve it ?", "Less commercials. I think it is mainly a cultural thing. If I grew up here my opinion might be different."], ["The third was JFK.", "I see. I wonder how rich president banana of Zimbabwe is haha. He may be the most loaded of all of them haha", "President Banana is an interesting name.

Tom Brady's wife makes double her husbands salary!", "I would be really happy if my wife made double what I make. That would be great!"], ["yeah, I'm one and I have a bunch of friends that do it. On average we make more than a football player!", "Oh that's awesome. And yep that is what I have heard did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players.

How about you?", "lol me too, I remember seeing pictures of some ridiculous costumes. I want to be a panda researcher though"], ["That's true. Do watch NFL football games?", "I sometimes watch. Usually about the Superbowl. What about you?", "I usually watch some games because my son really likes to watch football games."], ["I love Tom Hanks. I found it curious how the Lord of the Rings movies had huge losses despite being a success", "Wow, that's pretty surprising. Never know what's going to bring in the money huh? You know you'd figure anything Disney would be a sure hit but heard that their animated \"Treasure Planet\" was one of the most expensive box office", "Yes. And John Carter was a flop over here but broke box office records in Russia"], ["Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.", "Yes I do but not like ballet dancers. They can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.", "That is shocking. I used to date a ballet dancer actually. And I can confirm that they always have feet problems"], ["True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now.", "I find that pretty interesting!! Did you know when was the highest score in a football match ever?"], ["Me too, I'm surprised that Jupiter has radio storms they can be heard on AM radio.", "Yes. I wouldnt mind hearing those.", "I wonder what they sound like? What if it is actually aliens trying to talk with us?"], ["smart kid, took lots of ap tests in high school", "wow amazing. Brad Johnson is the only QB that threw himself a touchdown pass", "I did not even know such a thing is possible at all"], ["Me too. But I'm not sure what frequency it is. Kind of has me worried now!", "well maybe we will find out at some point. did you know we can grow a rib in 2-3 months", "No, that is shocking. How do they know that?"], ["No but I bet it's wild to see. Ha! Wonder if players are allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms while it's in play unlike regular soccer?", "Yeah I don't know it sounds more interesting to me than regular soccer though LOL, have you heard of the German player Mesut Ozil?", "I admire him because he donated his entire world cup bonus to pay for the surgeries of 23 different kids over in Brazil. I wish all athletes were like him!"], ["He was a very funny and interesting man. Something else that is funny is the University of Iowa painted the visiting locker room pink. I wonder what the visiting football teams thought about that.", "Yeah it was probably before pink became popular for professional football players to support breast cancer", "Do you watch a lot of football?"], ["Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went", "Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early"], ["Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive. I heard she was really good in that movie as well.", "It's funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder woman. She thought she was trying out for cat woman", "That is pretty funny, do you know what year the original wonder women made an appearance?"], ["Actually it was Georgia Tech against Cumberland, they beat them 222-0", "Hm. I figured that Tom Brady gave a biblical whooping to the Browns. Oh well. 222-0? Did Cumberland play with their cheerleaders or what?", "Hahah good point, I have no idea but what a defeat. Do you ever watch the ESPN?"], ["I do but i don't get the chance as much anymore. The patriots are on a role.", "Do you know how many teams are on the NFL?", "Wow that's a good question, how many?"], ["That is true. They produced a knock off lego once", "Wow, they have tried their hand on everything it seems, smart business people", "Very true. And they also own the Seattle Mariners. Good investment seems"], ["I'm surprised a building of that size has lasted so long", "I have no idea, but I am glad it survived. History should not be destroyed. Going back to football, the games apparently last only 11 minutes of active game", "I guess the players have other things to attend to. They are pretty busy. Sunday is a work day for them. I hope they are editing the Bible like that Jefferson fellow."], ["Yeah it cost a whooping $60 million, that is very expensive", "Yeah do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?", "Oh yeah the man is a legend, never fumbled the ball"], ["That makes sense. The NFL is using tracking chips on the players now.", "Yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others", "Yeah. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?"], ["Yes I have, very funny movie. That was a classic right there. Thanks", "I have never seen it before, I think Bill Murray said it was comedy gold or something like that.", "I agree. Did you know that some of the very first silent movies out there were comedies?"], ["Yeah, wasn't he the guy who didn't ever fumble the ball? Thats a pretty incredible feat.", "That sure is, what a career. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "That is surprising, I never saw bowling as that popular. But engineers make more over a lifetime than football players. So there is some incentive to work hard in school."], ["Where did you usually commute from and to? Technology and innovations fly by year after year.", "I simply drove to the big city for about an hour and a half. Did you ever use the car radio?", "That sounds like my commute. I commute about that long one way for school and back home. Doesn't every car have a radio?"], ["I'm a huge football fan. How about yourself?", "I love football both college and NFL, do you have a favorite NFL team of the 32?", "I'm a New England Patriots fan and huge fan of Tom Brady how about you?"], ["Well apparently there is a president in Zimbabwe called president banana", "They could do a musical number. I think that many fans would follow.", "See I like that idea haha. Maybe they could make a lot of money so that Trump could be back into the top three richest presidents of all time"], ["I do too. The Saints should do better, if not for themselves, but for the good of the league.", "Yeah I agree with you on that. Do you know what the average actual time of gameplay is for an average NFL game?", "Something like 10 minutes, right? I think I heard that when they were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads of the players."], ["I hope so too. We need engineers more than we need athletes if we're going to have a good society.", "True! Although it is pretty cool that there isn't a rule that keeps women from playing. All they need to do it meet eligibility", "I guess in the future we might see a woman. Anyway, great chat! Have a great evening!"], ["I don't know honestly. We have some teams that have won state championships in the area but i don't ever go to the games.", "I would think it would be more interesting if you went to the actual school.", "I would think so too but there's a school in Allen, Texas that spent 60 million dollars to build a football stadium to seat 18,000 people."], ["Yep, that's how consistently good they have been. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are eating somewhere and an NFL player comes in, they have", "Thats rude. I wonder why?", "They probably don't want any PR problems from that. It's kind of weird that there is no women in the NFL. There is no written rules against female players."], ["Really, Id be interested to read it. It does sound a little extreme at some times.", "I agree lol, do you have a favorite team?", "I do, unfortunately I root for the Dolphins, it was a family thing."], ["I do not think I have heard of that, what is it? There is a radio station that turns solar energy into sounds", "WOw cool one. Have you ever listened to canadian radios?", "I have not actually, I just do not have the time I guess. Back to football, Kellan Moore is the only half handed QB in the NFL."], ["Good point. The ESPN once won an Emmy. Do you know what for?", "Hmm I do not know that, did not know they could qualify for any of those awards", "Yeah, well they got it for the superimposed yellow like"], ["Yes, I did, interesting. I think they owned alot of land.", "I believe so too. Up until 1805 the vice president was decided by who the runner up was in the presidential election. Interesting because there probably would have been 2 different opinions on issues of the time in the White", "Yes, that is interesting. Its good times have changed."], ["Yeah and after words maybe on a subconscious level. You know the highest scoring game of all time?", "Yeah it was 222-0. What a blow out!", "Yeah Georgia Tech was not playing around. I would have hated to be on the bus ride home to Cumberland."], ["Im doing great. How bout you.", "I'm good, thanks for asking. Do you like Tennis?", "I have never really sat down to watch it to be honest."], ["I love the NFL! I try to follow all 32 teams the best I can.", "Nice. I did not know the game season is 17 weeks. That is a long time and lots of games", "Yes. It seems to go fast. Each team plays a 16 game schedule."], ["It That is an interesting coincidence.", "Did you know the NFL has no rules against women playing?", "That's great! There should a team entirely of women!"], ["Hello, do you like television?", "I do. I love watching SNL - especially the weekend update.", "I love SNL. Did you know when South Park aired the Family Guy episode, they received flowers from the Simpsons crew?"], ["Yes but I guess that was because bowling was much more popular back then", "I guess so. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", "Yes that is 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland"], ["I think soccer players make less money than a basketball player. But as a whole soccer is watched by a lot of people more in comparison to basketball. That is just my opinion", "Yea basketball players are making upwards of 50 million a year thats crazy. I know overseas soccer is a huge sport. In There exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time.", "I never heard of such thing. How 3 teams can play on the field at the same time is a mind blowing. Hahaha"], ["Well the NFL tracks everything. They even have chips in shoulder pads and footballs for tracking so I am pretty sure they are accurate.", "I think its great that tech is being integrated into the game, cool stats indeed they should make devices to control the brain damage injuries", "You would think that an average NFL player who will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime would want to help their own health. The NFL is violent."], ["Are you a baseball fan? I'm not, so I am not surprised that the Women's World cup has higher ratings than the World Series.", "Soccer is the international sport. Women around the world will be keen on seeing the games. Not so much for baseball, I guess. I am not a big baseball fan, though I follow the playoffs.", "I'm not a sports person, I do like chess. Although, I didn't know it was invented in India."], ["No! Wow, that's awesome! Very smart and kind of them. I love animals more than a lot of people lol!", "It is a great thing they did! i wish the U.S. would do that!", "I do too, we have so many animals going extinct it would probably help a lot. They deserve to thrive and be safe too."], ["Yeah I guess it was a more popular game back then. Their coaches are the highest paid people", "Yeah no surprise there.

Curious fact, the U of Iowa visitor locker room is painted pink."], ["Are you a New England Patriots fan?", "lol no I am not. Did you know there is no written rule against female players? women are allowed to play football.", "And sorry, yes I watch football. I am not a fan of the Patriots either! lol I did know about the rule allowing female players. I'm surprised no females play tho"], ["That must be a nightmare for opposing teams! Wonder if that would have helped Cumberland when Georgia Tech set the highest score record when they beat them 222-0. Ha!", "Haha that is true! It's so surprising that an average engineer will make more in his life than an NFL or MLB player", "Agreed. I even wonder if engineers made more than the top bowlers of the 1960s since they actually made more than the top football players as well!"], ["Yeah, no kidding. Although the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetime earning of an NFL player.", "Plus fewer concussions too. I think it would be better for women to go into engineering.", "Yeah, no kidding! I know the cheerleaders on the Saints have to leave a restaurant if a team player is there."], ["Free with you, they should have had Snoop Dogg make a theme song for the game like he did for his son's high school football team LOL", "Interesting, do you play golf?", "I have tried to play golf but I'm not very good, it just takes so long to do all 18 holes I think"], ["For sure, did you know the NFL is the new religion", "I guess it is, many people watch it for sure.

Have a great day"], ["They cannot socialize or date either.", "Well that i agree with but forcing them to leaves a bit much to me.", "Yeah probably something happened for them to make that rule. Well, cant wait till the draft lol. Gotta run, nice talking to you."], ["That was a beautiful show, both in the writing and visually. It's probably the best bit of TV Sci-Fi since 1997.", "Yes I thought so too", "It's been nice chatting with you, but I'd better get back to work."], ["Well I hope the players get their degrees before going to the NFL. The lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player", "They could probably get tons of degrees after the NFL", "lol. The bible is the best selling book ever selling over 5 billion copies. I know that because every one has one."], ["I guess the football players chose the wrong sport then. They could have just gone bowling and make money. They could wear their helmet bowling too.", "Well things have changed now so that definitely is not the case. But engineers still make more than football players", "Engineers makes more than football players, but not for playing football. Engineers are good at engineering."], ["I agree. Though the earnings of an engineer over their life time are higher that the earnings of a football player. That makes me feel a little better.", "Until you think about retirement age. I'll take ten and out with millions over forty plus and out with millions. lol. What about you?", "Same here. I would rather a few years to make my millions."], ["Yes, I forget how football is usually soccer to most people", "Soccer is a popular sport around the world.

The only good thing about this model is that it pays for the lesser sports, like swimming and volleyball.", "Did you know Espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line"], ["I think he is a pretty decent player. So was the former QB for Patriots, Benjarvus", "I think considering how many super bowl rings Brady had he is better than decent.", "Yeah that is true.

Do you?", "Yeah I do quite a bit I just have not managed to find that Jupiter station"], ["It is funny - bowling is a less athletic sport but they used to make twice as much as football players", "i think they now get paid more but not all of them", "yes that is true. Espn probably got more from winning an emmy for the creation of the virtual yellow line"], ["Yeah that is a wild fact, I guess the thing to do was to be a bowler in the 60's, that was the life!", "Sure would be a lot easier physically than football.

That would give more action.", "You know they have tracking chips in the player's shoulder pads that records every move on the field. It would be interesting to see what that data shows!"], ["Yeah that makes sense. Because I haven't heard of that rule with any other team. What about the rule for female players? Apparently there is no rule against it, which is interesting", "I guess they never imagined that women would want or be able to play. Other sports might not have such a rule either.", "Yeah that makes sense. I don't think that women can play basketball or anything like that, at least in the NBA, but maybe I'm wrong? Do you have a favorite quarterback by the way?"], ["True. 11 minutes of combat.", "I'm all for women breaking barriers and the belief that they can accomplish anything a man can, but not when there is a chance for major injury just based on a size advantage.", "True. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you!"], ["Yeah thats true. Looks like a lot of them just inherited the money", "And now the actors that play the characters are getting rich. Marvel movies make serious box office cash", "I know right. Have you seen infinity war?"], ["Yes, the talent is there, on the coaching staff too. Though I have heard accusations for cheating.", "Yes and while I am not familiar enough to know the details, which team hasn't been accused as such", "I really don't know. I figure that the cost of getting caught cheating would be pretty high. Didn't they have to pay a fine or something?"], ["Hi! I do occasionally, usually during big games like Super Bowl.", "Me too, I really don't watch much but I do like football.

I had no idea! I would have thought they did but I guess not.", "That is interesting but I wonder what the league's eligibility requirements are.

I just watched avengers the other day! Have you seen Wonder Woman?", "I haven't, but I should! It was the highest grossing superhero movie!", "I know! I've seen the Dark Knight too, have you?

Maybe they could get a pink locker room like the Univ of Iowa has for its visiting football teams. :) So bad! !", "Haha, right! That is crazy. It's not any different than the crazy high score game that ended with 222-0 that's unbelievable!", "Yeah that was awful for the losing team I bet. They probably could have benefited from the tracking chips they use today in the players' shoulder pads to record their moves. Maybe could have figured out what they were doing"], ["Would be awesome to watch!", "Yea, it's quite ironic that Jackson popularized the robot dance and wanted to build a robot lol", "Could he make it sing too?"], ["I can't believe google is only 10 years old!", "They have certainly grown pretty fast. I love YouTube!", "i do too! i also like google maps. Do you use that a lot?"], ["Me too, but I guess in my childhood and college years I was watching much often.

Do they believe it may bring any benefits to Iowa?"], ["I wonder too, there is an AM radio frequency that catches Jupiter's radio storms", "Very cool, wonder if it just sounds like static or what?

Did you know that bowlers made twice as much as top football stars ?", "Thats crazy. It like how engineers make more in a lifetime", "And what up with that crazy cumberland game. I would have walked off the field"], ["That's such a nice gesture. For the longest time he was the voice of college football. Did you go to Michigan?", "I did not just a big fan.

Is there anything else you enjoy?", "Yes it is indeed. I enjoy the Internet. It's addicting and can cause measurable changes in the brain."], ["I wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players", "I am not sure. In the 60s bowlers used to make more than NFL players", "Yeah I guess it was a more popular game back then. Their coaches are the highest paid people"], ["Wasn't he a running back for the NE Patriots?", "Yeah he was and he never fumbled the ball in his career", "That's impressive. I wonder how many years he played for the Patriots to have that kind of stat"], ["Now that's suprising. I wonder how much would that be", "I'm not sure. I think it's because NFL players do not play past their 30s normally", "True. How about golf? are you familiar with it?"], ["Yes. The Saints cheerleaders cannot even eat in the same restaurant as the players.", "I guess it is to keep the players from getting distracted or from bad press about teams.", "I'm sure. Even if the cheerleader is already there, if a player walks into the restaurant the cheerleader has to leave."], ["I guess that is not a lot considering how long they have been around", "That is true actually.

Can you believe there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay?", "I can. they do so much standing around and waiting. it feels like they try to run down the clock. i wouldnt buy a ticket. too expensive."], ["True. It was my pleasure to talk with you.", "Have a good day my friend watch a disney film for me today", "Sure."], ["Ha! Maybe so! I mean, there's only 11 minutes of live NFL gameplay on average so it wouldn't hurt to have a few female players, I wouldn't think!", "Maybe there is to many advertisements, what do yo think ? Or if the players played more than 11 minutes, they would get more injuries ?", "I think it's primarily the commercials. Crazy to think it's only 11 minutes though! I wonder if the chips they use to track the movement of players only tracks 11 minutes worth?"], ["Yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in", "Yes it is absurd and sexist and it needs to go", "I agree.

Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?", "Of course I do, he played for the Patriots and never fumbled the ball in his career"], ["That stat actually surprises me with how much football players work! Did you know that in the 60s even top bowlers made more than football players? !", "I wasn't aware of that, actually. That's sad and unfair - almost as bad as the Saints cheerleaders not being allowed to dine in the same restaurant as the football players.", "That's terrible, especially since the cheerleaders need to leave even if they were there first. Talk about no womens rights?"], ["How great is that! So important. The library of Alexandria had a unique way of gathering books by making all ships visiting surrender their books for copy .", "They must have had a impressive collection", "How unfair, they would copy their books give them back the copy and keep the originals."], ["Wow. Didn't know that. Antarctica has a disc golf course", "Oh that would be a cold course! A golf course in Dubai requires 4 million gallons of water!", "That is a lot of water. The US have more golf courses than the world combined"], ["How things have changed now.

I prefer the NFL to college football or any other league.", "I was shocked to find out that an average NFL game, only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.", "They do keep the time running while the teams are setting up & calling a new play a lot so I guess it's not too surprising.

Did you ever watch the show House MD?", "Yeah and he even taught Ellie Kemper, she is so funny. Yeah I watch House"], ["Are you a Star Wars fan?", "yes, i really like the original trilogy. You?", "Me too, it was so good!

Lucas pulled one over on them. The entire franchise is estimated to be $65 billion dollars!", "I know! It has cost them billions and made Lucas himself a billionaire."], ["Really? Haha, not sure if that worked! Marvel comic toys are expensive.", "Not sure but it just increases the profit margin for the company haha.", "True! I am going to have to watch this Infinity War movie now lol, curious about this Hawkeye character. Although he has been in other Marvel films."], ["Yes! I heard that many people were actually rooting against Brady's team, because they're kind of over them winning all the time. He sure works hard though, it seems.", "I think so, too. But there are other good players as well. I guess RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career.", "Pretty impressive. I know they get paid a lot for those skills, but did you realize that top bowlers in the 60's made twice as much as football stars then?"], ["Oh that makes so much sense. Do you know why Caine became an actor?", "Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went"], ["I heard it was really good, hes not my favorite superhero, but Id definitely see it also.", "Do you read any other comic books?", "No, never have read many of them. I miss out on a lot of back story that way."], ["I know! They sure do milk it for all its worth.", "ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv. That has been a good addition to watching games.", "Yeah, that was a good addition. Can't believe that Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled. Amazing!"], ["Not really. I find they have too much CGI. What about you?", "I like some of them like Spider-man. DO you know why there is a hyphen in the name?", "I have no idea why. Why not just one word? Other superheroes have names like that."], ["Hard to believe. I saw some pretty good jazz in New orleans once. Wasn't a huge fan but it is definitely popular.

I also see that clint eastwood is an enthusiast.", "I had no idea it was popular in Pakistan given that their jazz orchestra is topping the charts."], ["Yes they did. All came down to a stupid kick ha ha. Anyway, did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made more than top football players?", "No I didn't know that, I always hear that most sports make more than nfl, which I think it's unfair.", "I'm positive it's not the case now. Do you know what the highest score in a football game ever was?"], ["I know right, only 11 minutes, last Superbowl was more than 3 hours long, maybe 4 all of that for only 11 minutes", "All those advertisements make a lot of money for the NFL and the tickets are outrageous.

Look how far he came in life! what is it due to?", "Yes He did very well in his career. And they had the best selling album of the 2000's", "WHAT? that is so awesome. I wonder when they released their last song, do you know?"], ["I guess that's the idea. I can't imagine it really working or everyone would do it.", "Yeah I think it must be more of a tradition now, I doubt a color would really affect another team's performance.", "The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia tech defeated Cumberland 222-0.

Apparently one episode in the whole series did not have bart in it or mention him. I want to watch that episode", "i wonder what the episode was about. that is odd. the simpsons has great voice talent."], ["Well perhaps you can find a short version that only shows the live gameplay. Each game is only a dozen or so minutes long of real gameplay", "That's another reason why I don't watch football, three hours in front of the television for just 12 minutes of actual action. I could just grab my Bible instead.", "Do you read from the bible often?"], ["That should be fun for real. Did you know women can play in the NFL?", "Yes as long as they meet the requirements.

Lee", "I guess he chose her for the job. I never really watched the show.", "I see.

How about that 70s show, ever seen that?", "no, i didnt but i think it was a very popular show. probably a lot of actors launched big careers there.", "You're right, mostly all of them became something big after that.

That must have hurt."], ["Yeah I think so too. Gal Gadot who is the new wonder woman, actually served two years as a soldier.", "Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive.

Engineers make more than football players over their lifetime"], ["That kind of sucks, tickets tend to be really expensive and the game lasts for 3 hours, you would expect more than just 11 minutes of gameplay, really unfair.", "Yeah I know. Bowlers used to make more in the 60s than football players", "They did? I wonder what changed, bowling used to be really popular back in the day, it doesnt seem like a really popular sport now"], ["I know, honestly if it's a sport played with feet and a ball then i guess they have the right to call it that.", "That is true.

Can you believe top bowlers made more than top nfl players in the 60's?", "Did they really? That's shocking, I wonder why, maybe people didn't care about football as much back then.

Almost as much as espn winning an Emmy. do you know what for?"], ["It was a nice way to spend an afternoon. i try to watch the playoffs and the superbowl. this year i didnt.", "I watched the superbowl. I thought it was terrible, but that may just be me. So boring this year.", "I think it was probably better the year before. there was a big comeback. this year it was a defensive battle. i wanted the underdog to win. too bad."], ["Hi there, do you watch the NFL?", "Yes I like to watch NFL games, I try to watch as many games as I can, what about you?", "Nice, yes me too. Did you know women can play too?"], ["That is pretty impressive, that is probably part of why the Patriots have been one of the most dominant teams recently.", "Yes - the Patriots at least made a better decision than his high school - since they let tom Brady play!", "I bet they are really regretting that decision now."], ["And their feet look all weird for some reason", "Well putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes will absorb the odor.", "That is something I have to try tonight"], ["Hi, do you like football?", "Soccer or American football, i like them both.", "I like them both too, I did not realize that the season lasts 17 weeks"], ["Yes that is true and I am glad they came up with that line because it makes watching the game much easier", "Definitely. Can you believe the former Patriots running back never fumbled the football his entire career?", "That is so amazing.

They must have kept the laws from way back in time lol", "Lots of curious things that are fun to learn about. It has been great chatting with you. Thanks!"], ["Yeah that's for sure. I really thought that players earned alot more money though.", "Maybe the MVP but an engineer will earn more money than the NFL player, I think soccer players are paid better", "Crazy to think that one team scored 222 points in a game once too."], ["that is crazy, I bet NFL makes more money now by a long shot, it was nice chatting with you!", "Yeah that is true, things have really changed. Same here.", "Good bye!"], ["Do you know if they have female players?", "Well, not in the NFL they dont but i'm sure they might have a womans league", "Did you know that the nfl has no rules against women?

How about you?", "I love watching the NFL, it may be my new religion.

I've tried watching football on TV but it seems to go on forever, and is mostly replays of what has happened already.", "Yeah the average NFL game has 11 minutes of live gameplay, what do you think they could do to improve it ?", "Less commercials. I think it is mainly a cultural thing. If I grew up here my opinion might be different."], ["The third was JFK.", "I see. I wonder how rich president banana of Zimbabwe is haha. He may be the most loaded of all of them haha", "President Banana is an interesting name.

Tom Brady's wife makes double her husbands salary!", "I would be really happy if my wife made double what I make. That would be great!"], ["yeah, I'm one and I have a bunch of friends that do it. On average we make more than a football player!", "Oh that's awesome. And yep that is what I have heard did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players.

Usually about the Superbowl. What about you?", "I usually watch some games because my son really likes to watch football games."], ["I love Tom Hanks. I found it curious how the Lord of the Rings movies had huge losses despite being a success", "Wow, that's pretty surprising. Never know what's going to bring in the money huh? You know you'd figure anything Disney would be a sure hit but heard that their animated \"Treasure Planet\" was one of the most expensive box office", "Yes. And John Carter was a flop over here but broke box office records in Russia"], ["Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.", "Yes I do but not like ballet dancers. They can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.", "That is shocking. I used to date a ballet dancer actually. And I can confirm that they always have feet problems"], ["True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now.", "I find that pretty interesting!! Did you know when was the highest score in a football match ever?"], ["Me too, I'm surprised that Jupiter has radio storms they can be heard on AM radio.", "Yes. I wouldnt mind hearing those.", "I wonder what they sound like? What if it is actually aliens trying to talk with us?"], ["smart kid, took lots of ap tests in high school", "wow amazing. Brad Johnson is the only QB that threw himself a touchdown pass", "I did not even know such a thing is possible at all"], ["Me too. But I'm not sure what frequency it is. Kind of has me worried now!", "well maybe we will find out at some point. did you know we can grow a rib in 2-3 months", "No, that is shocking. How do they know that?"], ["No but I bet it's wild to see. Ha! Wonder if players are allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms while it's in play unlike regular soccer?", "Yeah I don't know it sounds more interesting to me than regular soccer though LOL, have you heard of the German player Mesut Ozil?", "I admire him because he donated his entire world cup bonus to pay for the surgeries of 23 different kids over in Brazil. I wish all athletes were like him!"], ["He was a very funny and interesting man. Something else that is funny is the University of Iowa painted the visiting locker room pink. I wonder what the visiting football teams thought about that.", "Yeah it was probably before pink became popular for professional football players to support breast cancer", "Do you watch a lot of football?"], ["Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went", "Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early"], ["Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive.

Good investment seems"], ["I'm surprised a building of that size has lasted so long", "I have no idea, but I am glad it survived. History should not be destroyed.

I hope they are editing the Bible like that Jefferson fellow."], ["Yeah it cost a whooping $60 million, that is very expensive", "Yeah do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?", "Oh yeah the man is a legend, never fumbled the ball"], ["That makes sense. The NFL is using tracking chips on the players now.", "Yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others", "Yeah. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?"], ["Yes I have, very funny movie. That was a classic right there. Thanks", "I have never seen it before, I think Bill Murray said it was comedy gold or something like that.", "I agree. Did you know that some of the very first silent movies out there were comedies?"], ["Yeah, wasn't he the guy who didn't ever fumble the ball? Thats a pretty incredible feat.", "That sure is, what a career. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "That is surprising, I never saw bowling as that popular. But engineers make more over a lifetime than football players. So there is some incentive to work hard in school."], ["Where did you usually commute from and to? Technology and innovations fly by year after year.", "I simply drove to the big city for about an hour and a half. Did you ever use the car radio?", "That sounds like my commute. I commute about that long one way for school and back home. Doesn't every car have a radio?"], ["I'm a huge football fan. How about yourself?", "I love football both college and NFL, do you have a favorite NFL team of the 32?", "I'm a New England Patriots fan and huge fan of Tom Brady how about you?"], ["Well apparently there is a president in Zimbabwe called president banana", "They could do a musical number. I think that many fans would follow.", "See I like that idea haha. Maybe they could make a lot of money so that Trump could be back into the top three richest presidents of all time"], ["I do too. The Saints should do better, if not for themselves, but for the good of the league.", "Yeah I agree with you on that. Do you know what the average actual time of gameplay is for an average NFL game?", "Something like 10 minutes, right? I think I heard that when they were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads of the players."], ["I hope so too. We need engineers more than we need athletes if we're going to have a good society.", "True! Although it is pretty cool that there isn't a rule that keeps women from playing. All they need to do it meet eligibility", "I guess in the future we might see a woman. Anyway, great chat! Have a great evening!"], ["I don't know honestly. We have some teams that have won state championships in the area but i don't ever go to the games.", "I would think it would be more interesting if you went to the actual school.", "I would think so too but there's a school in Allen, Texas that spent 60 million dollars to build a football stadium to seat 18,000 people."], ["Yep, that's how consistently good they have been. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are eating somewhere and an NFL player comes in, they have", "Thats rude. I wonder why?", "They probably don't want any PR problems from that. It's kind of weird that there is no women in the NFL. There is no written rules against female players."], ["Really, Id be interested to read it. It does sound a little extreme at some times.", "I agree lol, do you have a favorite team?", "I do, unfortunately I root for the Dolphins, it was a family thing."], ["I do not think I have heard of that, what is it? There is a radio station that turns solar energy into sounds", "WOw cool one. Have you ever listened to canadian radios?", "I have not actually, I just do not have the time I guess. Back to football, Kellan Moore is the only half handed QB in the NFL."], ["Good point. The ESPN once won an Emmy. Do you know what for?", "Hmm I do not know that, did not know they could qualify for any of those awards", "Yeah, well they got it for the superimposed yellow like"], ["Yes, I did, interesting. I think they owned alot of land.", "I believe so too. Up until 1805 the vice president was decided by who the runner up was in the presidential election. Interesting because there probably would have been 2 different opinions on issues of the time in the White", "Yes, that is interesting. Its good times have changed."], ["Yeah and after words maybe on a subconscious level. You know the highest scoring game of all time?", "Yeah it was 222-0. What a blow out!", "Yeah Georgia Tech was not playing around. I would have hated to be on the bus ride home to Cumberland."], ["Im doing great. How bout you.", "I'm good, thanks for asking. Do you like Tennis?", "I have never really sat down to watch it to be honest."], ["I love the NFL! I try to follow all 32 teams the best I can.", "Nice. I did not know the game season is 17 weeks.

There should a team entirely of women!"], ["Hello, do you like television?", "I do. I love watching SNL - especially the weekend update.", "I love SNL. Did you know when South Park aired the Family Guy episode, they received flowers from the Simpsons crew?"], ["Yes but I guess that was because bowling was much more popular back then", "I guess so. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", "Yes that is 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland"], ["I think soccer players make less money than a basketball player. But as a whole soccer is watched by a lot of people more in comparison to basketball. That is just my opinion", "Yea basketball players are making upwards of 50 million a year thats crazy. I know overseas soccer is a huge sport. In There exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time.", "I never heard of such thing. How 3 teams can play on the field at the same time is a mind blowing. Hahaha"], ["Well the NFL tracks everything. They even have chips in shoulder pads and footballs for tracking so I am pretty sure they are accurate.", "I think its great that tech is being integrated into the game, cool stats indeed they should make devices to control the brain damage injuries", "You would think that an average NFL player who will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime would want to help their own health. The NFL is violent."], ["Are you a baseball fan? I'm not, so I am not surprised that the Women's World cup has higher ratings than the World Series.", "Soccer is the international sport.

Although, I didn't know it was invented in India."], ["No! Wow, that's awesome! Very smart and kind of them. I love animals more than a lot of people lol!", "It is a great thing they did! i wish the U.S. would do that!", "I do too, we have so many animals going extinct it would probably help a lot. They deserve to thrive and be safe too."], ["Yeah I guess it was a more popular game back then. Their coaches are the highest paid people", "Yeah no surprise there.

I am not a fan of the Patriots either! lol I did know about the rule allowing female players. I'm surprised no females play tho"], ["That must be a nightmare for opposing teams! Wonder if that would have helped Cumberland when Georgia Tech set the highest score record when they beat them 222-0. Ha!", "Haha that is true! It's so surprising that an average engineer will make more in his life than an NFL or MLB player", "Agreed. I even wonder if engineers made more than the top bowlers of the 1960s since they actually made more than the top football players as well!"], ["Yeah, no kidding. Although the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetime earning of an NFL player.", "Plus fewer concussions too. I think it would be better for women to go into engineering.", "Yeah, no kidding! I know the cheerleaders on the Saints have to leave a restaurant if a team player is there."], ["Free with you, they should have had Snoop Dogg make a theme song for the game like he did for his son's high school football team LOL", "Interesting, do you play golf?", "I have tried to play golf but I'm not very good, it just takes so long to do all 18 holes I think"], ["For sure, did you know the NFL is the new religion", "I guess it is, many people watch it for sure.

It's crazy there is 5000 year old shoes that perform better than modern shoes", "I'm not surprised, considering how much stuff today is deliberately designed to fall apart so you have to buy more. Sounds like you've got about as many shoes as I do."], ["That's a good point that I never thought about. What is also interesting to me is that an NFL game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it that seems super low.", "Yeah, that makes sense, it is mostly standing around if you ask me. I still love the game, but the clock watching gets annoying.", "Yep I agree with that. Do you watch any fantasy movies. Or do you do fantasy football at all"], ["Maybe so. I hope the data they are collecting in the field though can somehow be used to make the game a little bit safer", "Amazing that a game which averages just over 10 minutes of actual gameplay can be so damaging to players.", "Great point.

I wish all athletes were like him!"], ["He was a very funny and interesting man. Something else that is funny is the University of Iowa painted the visiting locker room pink.

Thanks", "I have never seen it before, I think Bill Murray said it was comedy gold or something like that.", "I agree.

Thats a pretty incredible feat.", "That sure is, what a career. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "That is surprising, I never saw bowling as that popular.

We have some teams that have won state championships in the area but i don't ever go to the games.", "I would think it would be more interesting if you went to the actual school.", "I would think so too but there's a school in Allen, Texas that spent 60 million dollars to build a football stadium to seat 18,000 people."], ["Yep, that's how consistently good they have been. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are eating somewhere and an NFL player comes in, they have", "Thats rude.

Do you watch football?", "yes well I did watch the superbowl but I don't watch it regularly no, what about you", "Sometimes, but not every week. I would get bored watching for 17 weeks straight during the regular season and then the playoffs and Super Bowl."], ["Right. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house", "Yeah that is pretty cool, they must get a lot of people there so maybe that is why", "Yeah. Have you heard the president of Indonesia is a pop star?"], ["That was the culture then. People loved bowling. Oh, I was born at the wrong time.", "Yeah it seems it was the case back then. DO you know what the highest score in college football is?", "The highest score means little to me unless I could win money. What was it though?"], ["I'm not sure. Who was it?", "It was Georgia tech who scored 222 against Cumberland 0", "Holy smokes! I bet that was a long game for Cumberland. In the 1960's bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars."], ["hi there, do you watch the NFL?", "I sure do. Do you have a favorite team or player?", "I sure do. I love the Patriot and Tom is amazing. Do you have one?"], ["Yeah I think the highest paid people in most states are college coaches.", "Not sure how I feel about that. I have to send two kids through college one day, with the high cost of college I'm not sure I want a portion going to the football coach.", "Yeah its pretty crazy to me just how much it costs to attend college these days."], ["Absolutely. It's the next on my list.", "Have you watched any of the other Marvel movies?", "I'm not normally much of a comics or superhero person. Have you?"], ["Interesting, have you ever seen house?", "I have seen it, great drama tv series", "Apparently Hugh Laurie was making $700k an episode! !"], ["I bet you they do it for both. They need to track lots of stats like velocity and rotation and such and they will likely need the averages of those", "We live in amazing times. I can see where that would be useful. If a running back is getting tire during the game they know right away", "Yeah we sure do. Did you know women can play too in the NFL?"], ["There are a lot who play on high school teams, so if they meet the requirements, why not?", "Yeah, but the average earning potential salary of an engineer is higher", "lol Bowlers in the 60's made more than football players. THAT is hilarious."], ["True, I guess we'll never know.

I heard even 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars!", "I believe that. Bowling was a big sport back in the day. Football players didnt have the players union back then so they didnt make nearly what they deserved. I would say now it is a little over the top", "I agree. Especially if you are like the patriots benjarvus green-ellis who never even fumbled one game in his nfl career."], ["That would be Jupiter's moon? I wonder if Jupiter is one of the five planets visible to the naked eye.", "I would guess from it size it is", "The planet Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise and has no seasons.

I never knew that.", "Yah, did you know the other word for telephone is a phone?", "Yes. I knew that one."], ["Yeah I know he has won a few games there. Did you know he was picked 19th back in the 2000 NFL draft?", "I did not! He's been around for a while, I'm surprised he hasn't retired yet. His history as a football player is impressive. Been to the super bowl 8 times with the patriots.", "Yeah he sure has, I don't think he will retire for at least two more seasons."], ["No I never been to Texas yet but that's pretty crazy", "Yeah it is right? And it cost $60 million and on top of all , it is just a high school stadium", "They do love football in Texas, too bad they don't care as much about education, an average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average NFL player"], ["That is something. the lost 222-0. That is crazy !", "What is wrong is how the cheerleaders cant eat with the players", "Yeah the have to leave when they come in. I will research why"], ["Yeah I guess the career of a football player does not last that long so they do not have much time to make money", "True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now."], ["Hello! Do you like Football?", "I do. Do you?", "Of course! What's your favorite team. Mine is the New England Patriots, the Lannisters of the NFL!"], ["Maybe they can even see how long games are since they think only about 11 minutes are live gameplay!", "No kidding, right? I mean, these engineers already make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players, so they should step their game up... even though they are doing a phenomenal job now.", "That stat actually surprises me with how much football players work! Did you know that in the 60s even top bowlers made more than football players? !"], ["Yes thats really something", "Any other movies, books, or shows that you are into?", "I liked the lost series on tv"], ["But even today, NFL players don't make as much on average as I would think. Engineers earn more over a lifetime.", "Yes, and it's interesting to consider the lifetime career of a football player. Some use their background to transition to other fields such as coaching, or use the income to start a new career after they retire. Sadly, others suffer", "It's amazing how much technology is used in the NFL these days"], ["That is impressive. That makes a great actor.", "Yes it does, are you a fan of comic books, if you are, how many books do you have?", "I am not. But appears that their is a lot of money in the industry."], ["I know that it is the best selling book of all time with total sales of over 5 billion copies!", "Yeah that seems a lot.

On the subject of shoes, my old work boots have lasted me about 6 years but it's about time to get some new ones at", "I think I have 2 pairs of shoes. It's crazy there is 5000 year old shoes that perform better than modern shoes", "I'm not surprised, considering how much stuff today is deliberately designed to fall apart so you have to buy more. Sounds like you've got about as many shoes as I do."], ["That's a good point that I never thought about. What is also interesting to me is that an NFL game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it that seems super low.", "Yeah, that makes sense, it is mostly standing around if you ask me. I still love the game, but the clock watching gets annoying.", "Yep I agree with that. Do you watch any fantasy movies. Or do you do fantasy football at all"], ["Maybe so. I hope the data they are collecting in the field though can somehow be used to make the game a little bit safer", "Amazing that a game which averages just over 10 minutes of actual gameplay can be so damaging to players.", "Great point.

I was not born when they formed in 1960", "I wasn't either, they were amazing and still are. They couldn't even read music which is so interesting!"], ["I would guess that has something to do with breast cancer awareness.

Thanks for asking and you?", "I am fine too", "Do you like watching movies?"], ["Yeah so sad. In Texas on the other hand they are voting to rename the garbage dump", "Hahha so funny.

Oh yeah, the average lifetime earning is higher than the average NFL player!", "yup good to know haha, do you like the Saints? I don't like how they treat their cheer leaders"], ["Yeah I was wandering about that as well. How about radio dramas, do you like those?", "I don't like dramas in general so probably not.", "I see, because if you did there is a free radio to listen to them to"], ["The guy is a legend, he has ever fumbled the ball in his career", "Exactly.

Do you know much about the Bible?", "I know that is it one of the most influential books and has sold over 5 billion copies"], ["Hi, how are you?", "Good, and you? I haven't seen any superhero movies in a long time, but I think I saw a brief portion of Iron Man once on a TV that was going at my job.", "Really! I feel like all the movies coming out now, like 25% are super hero movies. Do you not enjoy them?"], ["If you want a job that makes more in a lifetime than an average nfl player or mlb player you can become an engineer", "I saw that, it is probably because there a bunch of players that last only a year or so. I'm not surprised, engineers make a lot of money.", "If you were a bowler in the 1960's you could have made twice as much as top football stars too."], ["That is pretty neat. I bet it is pretty diverse.", "Yeah. They must have comics from all over the world", "Probably a lot of older comics too. That would be neat to see the development of comics."], ["Yes I agree. I would like to know more about that. Up until 1805 the runner up automatically became the vice president. Kind of makes sense but it would never work now!", "NO it would not. The parties hate each other too much for that to ever work", "I wish they didn't. Just so much more productive to work together. I wonder who has stayed in the presidents guest house? It is actually bigger than the White House."], ["He could have had some unusual moves. LOL", "The ability to moon walk!", "Or to lean way back or forward. LOL"], ["Oh that is interesting since those are usually considered to be associated with peace.", "yeah. I hear if you publish a book in Norway the government buys 1000 to donate to libraries.", "That sounds pretty generous!"], ["If you fly to mars under constant 1g acceleration it will only take 2 or 3 days. I thought it took a lot longer.", "Me too! Movies make them seem longer, but they might be going much much slower for airtime lol.", "That is true. Have you heard about the lost satellite on mars?"], ["Bye!", "The president is the title given to the head of the government.", "That's true I think it's called different things in different places though right?"], ["I'm doing good too. Glad it's Friday. I watch both baseball and football. What about you?", "Me too, but I guess in my childhood and college years I was watching much often. I didn't know that 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to American college football teams. Did you know that?", "I did not know that. The University of Iowa's lock room for visiting teams is painted in all pink."], ["Yes as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements they can play! I would like to see a girl play.", "They cannot eat in the same place as the players, at least the Saints cheerleaders.", "That is a weird rule. How did they enforce the rules of the cheerleaders being required to leave?"], ["Who isn't?", "I think some of the newer movies are redundant to be honest.", "Really? Like which ones?"], ["Yeah and they have cancelled 100 shows since they came to be in 1989", "I guess that is not a lot considering how long they have been around", "That is true actually. Do you know the programming language Python?"], ["I mean I don't think kids should play past midnight but to make it a law is ridiculous", "Yeah, that is pretty absurd. Did you know nintendo produced a lego knock off?", "No, I did know they made playing cards though"], ["Nice, that's what I do. Did you know there is only 11 minutes of gameplay per game?", "Wow, it seems like a lot more but it is a pretty slow game. That sounds like an awfully small amount of time. Kinda like it's hard to believe that an engineer makes more money in their lifetime than an", "Yeah, for sure, they stand around a real lot."], ["Fans also felt though that in previous movies Hawkeye has not been given justice.", "True, I heard that too. I can't say because I havent seen the movie. But I do enjoy the Marvel Comic films.", "Yeah, I like the Marvel Comics series that they have on Netflix."], ["Hi. How are you?", "I'm doing well how are you! ?", "I am good too."], ["What? That is a strange fact. I guess she had a chance to do the voice work. She is a celebrity, after all.", "Did you ever play tennis? serena has been playing since she was 13, which is about when I started playing, but she's obviously way better LOL", "I assumed that she started sooner. She must have picked it up quick. I didn't real play. Anyway, great chat! Thanks!"], ["I have a passing knowledge of football and watch it occasionally as well", "What teams do you like", "I like the new England patriots. They are like the Lannisters of football"], ["Hi! Yes, I really enjoy watching football, both collegiate and professional. Do you?", "Yes, me too. I didn't know that the highest score in a football was 222-0 and it happened in 1916. Did you know that?", "That's insane! Either the team was really good or the other team was really good. Or maybe they were on strike about their pay since it seems like they don't make a lot."], ["If I were on the losing side I think I would have given up playing. Maybe they could have turned to the bible.", "Maybe. At least Cumberland probably didn't have a pink locker room like that of U. of Iowa. In 1916, they probably didn't have a locker room at all.", "I don't think they went in for those silly games back then, probably more respectful to the other team."], ["Hi there, do you watch the NFL?", "Hi! Yes I do sometimes. What's your favorite team?", "I think the Patriots, I like them best. One of their former QB never fumbled a ball in his career. How about you?"], ["Hello, are you by any chance a fan of the New England Patriots football team?", "I know some about them. Mostly stuff about Tom Brady", "Great. What do you think of his record as a QB?"], ["That's interesting, and kind of interesting thing NOT to do regularly.", "I don't know how many Navajo fans there are. George never won an Oscar though.", "that's sad considering how amazing his movies were"], ["Yes, she is a talented actress. I bet she did a great job. Anyway, thanks for the chat.", "It has a solid cast overall. Hope you get to catch it some time.", "Have a good day! Talk to you soon, Im sure."], ["I'm sure if they do they will have tracking chips on their shoulder pads like they do now so they can record every move on the field.", "That seems bit invasive but I guess all kinds of stats are taken out of those chips", "Yes. They even have chips in the footballs to track velocity, etc. Getting a little too technical I think for a sport."], ["Hello, do you like Disney?", "Yes, I do like Disney. They have done many great films and have some great theme parks.", "Do you know the original Disney is in California and not Florida?"], ["Hi. Do you watch football?", "yes well I did watch the superbowl but I don't watch it regularly no, what about you", "Sometimes, but not every week. I would get bored watching for 17 weeks straight during the regular season and then the playoffs and Super Bowl."], ["Right. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house", "Yeah that is pretty cool, they must get a lot of people there so maybe that is why", "Yeah. Have you heard the president of Indonesia is a pop star?"], ["That was the culture then. People loved bowling. Oh, I was born at the wrong time.", "Yeah it seems it was the case back then. DO you know what the highest score in college football is?", "The highest score means little to me unless I could win money. What was it though?"], ["I'm not sure. Who was it?", "It was Georgia tech who scored 222 against Cumberland 0", "Holy smokes! I bet that was a long game for Cumberland. In the 1960's bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars."], ["hi there, do you watch the NFL?", "I sure do. Do you have a favorite team or player?", "I sure do. I love the Patriot and Tom is amazing. Do you have one?"], ["Yeah I think the highest paid people in most states are college coaches.", "Not sure how I feel about that. I have to send two kids through college one day, with the high cost of college I'm not sure I want a portion going to the football coach.", "Yeah its pretty crazy to me just how much it costs to attend college these days."], ["Absolutely. It's the next on my list.", "Have you watched any of the other Marvel movies?", "I'm not normally much of a comics or superhero person. Have you?"], ["Interesting, have you ever seen house?", "I have seen it, great drama tv series", "Apparently Hugh Laurie was making $700k an episode! !"], ["I bet you they do it for both. They need to track lots of stats like velocity and rotation and such and they will likely need the averages of those", "We live in amazing times. I can see where that would be useful. If a running back is getting tire during the game they know right away", "Yeah we sure do. Did you know women can play too in the NFL?"], ["There are a lot who play on high school teams, so if they meet the requirements, why not?", "Yeah, but the average earning potential salary of an engineer is higher", "lol Bowlers in the 60's made more than football players. THAT is hilarious."], ["True, I guess we'll never know. It was great talking with you though, have a good one!", "It was nice chatting with you too.", "You as well, I hope you have a good rest of the evening, I'll try not to think about the depths of space that much !"], ["I watched the series, but didn't play the game. Do you know Nintendo is over 100 years old?", "I didnt know its over 100 years old, I wonder how the games from that time look like.", "Well, they started out as a playing card company."], ["You would think! I heard even 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as football stars!", "I believe that. Bowling was a big sport back in the day. Football players didnt have the players union back then so they didnt make nearly what they deserved. I would say now it is a little over the top", "I agree. Especially if you are like the patriots benjarvus green-ellis who never even fumbled one game in his nfl career."], ["That would be Jupiter's moon? I wonder if Jupiter is one of the five planets visible to the naked eye.", "I would guess from it size it is", "The planet Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise and has no seasons. That seems boring."], ["I've been a bigger fan in the past. I was a Caps fan growing up.", "I am a Caps fan too! Do you know how much a player loses weight per game?", "Like 8 pounds. I assume that's mostly sweat."], ["Yes it is, so that much mean that he was thinking about this movie for 11 years?", "That is impressive. That makes a great actor.", "Yes it does, are you a fan of comic books, if you are, how many books do you have?"], ["No I don't but curious", "I never have either, do you / did you play any of the sports we talked about?", "I have always been a soccer person"], ["300 of them? that sounds impressive and too bad, maybe his manuscript is really good, he could have been a rich man,", "Oh for sure! Do you like science at all?", "I do like science, I think that scientists make big contributions to society, they make human kind better and smarter."], ["It amazes me that a hockey player was once traded for a dollar", "He must have been worth less than that to the trading team. Maybe they were paying him too much already. Do you play hockey?", "I do not, but many Canadians do, since both hockey and lacrosse are their national sport."], ["Wow. I never knew that.", "Yah, did you know the other word for telephone is a phone?", "Yes. I knew that one."], ["Yeah I know he has won a few games there. Did you know he was picked 19th back in the 2000 NFL draft?", "I did not! He's been around for a while, I'm surprised he hasn't retired yet. His history as a football player is impressive. Been to the super bowl 8 times with the patriots.", "Yeah he sure has, I don't think he will retire for at least two more seasons."], ["No I never been to Texas yet but that's pretty crazy", "Yeah it is right? And it cost $60 million and on top of all , it is just a high school stadium", "They do love football in Texas, too bad they don't care as much about education, an average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average NFL player"], ["That is something. the lost 222-0. That is crazy !", "What is wrong is how the cheerleaders cant eat with the players", "Yeah the have to leave when they come in. I will research why"], ["Yeah I guess the career of a football player does not last that long so they do not have much time to make money", "True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now."], ["Hello! Do you like Football?", "I do. Do you?", "Of course! What's your favorite team. Mine is the New England Patriots, the Lannisters of the NFL!"], ["Maybe they can even see how long games are since they think only about 11 minutes are live gameplay!", "No kidding, right? I mean, these engineers already make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players, so they should step their game up... even though they are doing a phenomenal job now.", "That stat actually surprises me with how much football players work! Did you know that in the 60s even top bowlers made more than football players? !"], ["Yes thats really something", "Any other movies, books, or shows that you are into?", "I liked the lost series on tv"], ["But even today, NFL players don't make as much on average as I would think. Engineers earn more over a lifetime.", "Yes, and it's interesting to consider the lifetime career of a football player. Some use their background to transition to other fields such as coaching, or use the income to start a new career after they retire. Sadly, others suffer", "It's amazing how much technology is used in the NFL these days"], ["That is impressive. That makes a great actor.", "Yes it does, are you a fan of comic books, if you are, how many books do you have?", "I am not. But appears that their is a lot of money in the industry."], ["I know that it is the best selling book of all time with total sales of over 5 billion copies!", "Yeah that seems a lot. Jefferson apparently made his own version of the Bible", "I didn't know that. Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams were the only 2 U.S. presidents who didn't use the bible when they were sworn in."], ["Perhaps a combination of the winning team being just that good and the losing team being so bad", "Ive seen some blow outs, but never by that much.", "Did you every play fantasy football?"], ["I noticed that. I've heard of some weird ideas for sports, but that's out there. On the subject of shoes, my old work boots have lasted me about 6 years but it's about time to get some new ones at", "I think I have 2 pairs of shoes. It's crazy there is 5000 year old shoes that perform better than modern shoes", "I'm not surprised, considering how much stuff today is deliberately designed to fall apart so you have to buy more. Sounds like you've got about as many shoes as I do."], ["That's a good point that I never thought about. What is also interesting to me is that an NFL game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it that seems super low.", "Yeah, that makes sense, it is mostly standing around if you ask me. I still love the game, but the clock watching gets annoying.", "Yep I agree with that. Do you watch any fantasy movies. Or do you do fantasy football at all"], ["Maybe so. I hope the data they are collecting in the field though can somehow be used to make the game a little bit safer", "Amazing that a game which averages just over 10 minutes of actual gameplay can be so damaging to players.", "Great point. Do you know what the highest score recorded in a game was?"], ["no way! I would love to learn that. Were you into the beatles much?", "I loved them as a kid. I was not born when they formed in 1960", "I wasn't either, they were amazing and still are. They couldn't even read music which is so interesting!"], ["I would guess that has something to do with breast cancer awareness. I know that many football players suffer from breast cancer in the later years.", "I never thought of it that way, that's an interesting perspective. Tell me why you like soccer.", "It is a good game for women. I think women fight harder on the pitch than men do."], ["Crazy. Take care.", "Thank you. You too.", ":)"], ["I'm fine. Thanks for asking and you?", "I am fine too", "Do you like watching movies?"], ["Yeah so sad. In Texas on the other hand they are voting to rename the garbage dump", "Hahha so funny. In the UK not all men could vote until 1918", "I wonder what prevented them from doing, maybe class and ranking in society"], ["That's right.

Oh yeah, the average lifetime earning is higher than the average NFL player!", "yup good to know haha, do you like the Saints? I don't like how they treat their cheer leaders"], ["Yeah I was wandering about that as well. How about radio dramas, do you like those?", "I don't like dramas in general so probably not.", "I see, because if you did there is a free radio to listen to them to"], ["The guy is a legend, he has ever fumbled the ball in his career", "Exactly. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", "Yes I feel bad for Cumberland to lose 222-0 from Georgia Tech"], ["hope so too. now they are using tracking chips on the players", "That's pretty cool, they can find out how hard a player hits and moves with those chips", "yes, very handy. do you know what the highest score is in football history?"], ["Oh, your explanation is making so much sense. Thank you.", "There is a lot of technical data, like the area code 212 was chosen because it was easier to dial on a rotary phone.", "That fact to me is reasonable because New York was one of the earliest established cities in the U.S history."], ["Yes a lot.

Did you know ESPN won and Emmy once?", "It was for the superimposed yellow line and I think they deserved it", "Yup. DO you know much about the Bible?"], ["Yes they are collecting information such as velocity and rotation and a bunch others, Wonder what for though.", "I hope they can somehow use them to make the game safer and decrease the number of concussions", "That would be amazing. On another topic, do you know anything about the Bible?"], ["Are you a Star Wars fan?", "Yes, star wars is great. i really like the original trilogy.", "Me too, that was the best out of all the movies, and basically the only ones I watched.

Did you ever watch the show House MD?", "Yeah and he even taught Ellie Kemper, she is so funny. Yeah I watch House"], ["Are you a Star Wars fan?", "yes, i really like the original trilogy.

Maybe I should check them out", "Well there is a free website of them if you would like to check it out"], ["That is a lot of money! Did you know that 20th Century Fox agreed to forgo a $500k directing fee to let Lucas keep the licensing and merchandise rights?", "I wonder how they feel about that now. Lucas pulled one over on them. The entire franchise is estimated to be $65 billion dollars!", "I know! It has cost them billions and made Lucas himself a billionaire."], ["Really? Haha, not sure if that worked! Marvel comic toys are expensive.", "Not sure but it just increases the profit margin for the company haha.", "True! I am going to have to watch this Infinity War movie now lol, curious about this Hawkeye character. Although he has been in other Marvel films."], ["Yes! I heard that many people were actually rooting against Brady's team, because they're kind of over them winning all the time. He sure works hard though, it seems.", "I think so, too. But there are other good players as well. I guess RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career.", "Pretty impressive. I know they get paid a lot for those skills, but did you realize that top bowlers in the 60's made twice as much as football stars then?"], ["Oh that makes so much sense.

He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went"], ["I heard it was really good, hes not my favorite superhero, but Id definitely see it also.", "Do you read any other comic books?", "No, never have read many of them. I miss out on a lot of back story that way."], ["I know! They sure do milk it for all its worth.", "ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv.

I havent had much chance to do recently. You?", "I like them, but only in outdoor arenas. Not so much the indoor stuff."], ["They are the second largest search engine on the internet.

I wish all athletes were like him!"], ["He was a very funny and interesting man. Something else that is funny is the University of Iowa painted the visiting locker room pink.

He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went", "Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early"], ["Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive.

Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are eating somewhere and an NFL player comes in, they have", "Thats rude.

How 3 teams can play on the field at the same time is a mind blowing. Hahaha"], ["Well the NFL tracks everything. They even have chips in shoulder pads and footballs for tracking so I am pretty sure they are accurate.", "I think its great that tech is being integrated into the game, cool stats indeed they should make devices to control the brain damage injuries", "You would think that an average NFL player who will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime would want to help their own health.

Would pink locker rooms have helped Cumberland, do you think?"], ["yeah, i bet the simpsons liked that. the simpsons has had trouble maintaining its quality over the last few years. i think that comedy is quite difficult.", "Yea I stopped watching years ago. Apparently one episode in the whole series did not have bart in it or mention him. I want to watch that episode", "i wonder what the episode was about. that is odd. the simpsons has great voice talent."], ["Well perhaps you can find a short version that only shows the live gameplay. Each game is only a dozen or so minutes long of real gameplay", "That's another reason why I don't watch football, three hours in front of the television for just 12 minutes of actual action. I could just grab my Bible instead.", "Do you read from the bible often?"], ["That should be fun for real. Did you know women can play in the NFL?", "Yes as long as they meet the requirements. I wonder if any of them have tried", "Curious about that too. Maybe they are sticking to engineering careers"], ["that's sad considering how amazing his movies were", "The Academy has a lot of politics. He made the wrong kinds of films. His wife got an award.", "What did she get an award for?"], ["Yeah for sure. and that weird rule about new orleans cheerleaders?", "Yeah that seems like such a silly outdated rule. I think that will be gone in the next year or two.", "I hope so. did you know U of Iowa's locker room for visitors is painted pink?"], ["Yeah it was actually Stan Lee's wife, Joan B. Lee", "I guess he chose her for the job. I never really watched the show.", "I see. The Spider-man musical is the most expensive production on Broadway"], ["Yes that would be JFK, Washington and Jefferson", "Right. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house", "Yeah that is pretty cool, they must get a lot of people there so maybe that is why"], ["That is so cool. There is a piano that was found on the highest mountain in Britain", "Wow wonder who put it up there. Do you like Michael Jackson?", "I do actually he has some amazing music. He was once supposed to do a duet with Freddy Mercury but that did not go through"], ["Yeah , what a talent. Oscar were nominated for 9 Emmys. Wonder how that works", "Yeah I am confused too about that. Do you know how many Oscars are given out?", "Yes there are 24 awards given over a range of categories"], ["Exactly. Did you know engineers make more than them over their lifetime?", "I am not surprised as they have longer careers so more time to make money", "Yeah true.

What is it called?"], ["18 holes a games. Seems like a long day.", "Yeah it does. I like football a bit more. I love the NFL because they have 32 teams so people are bound to find one they like.", "Yes football is way better. That is true but you usually only hear about a select few."], ["yep, and pokemon cards that are worth some money. How about that 70s show, ever seen that?", "no, i didnt but i think it was a very popular show. probably a lot of actors launched big careers there.", "You're right, mostly all of them became something big after that. I wish the same was for that 70s show uk remake, they only lasted 10 episodes."], ["Yes I did Snoop Dogg wrote a song for his son's football team once", "Wow nice. Bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "I guess it was a more popular sport back in the day"], ["It's a shame what happened to Andy Dalton", "Yes, his thumb injury put him out for the rest of the season.", "He was having one of his best seasons so far"], ["Yeah I do.

Did you know politicians in Kentucky must swear an oath that they've never participated in a duel before taking office?", "No I didn't! Even in this day and age they still have to do that?", "I guess so lol.

I can't see how soldiers in WW I could make a radio out of razor blades and pencils? Wow.", "lol, that takes pure science around that. I can't even get my already made radio to work!", "Ha. I would just end up cutting myself. I guess they may have tuned into Jupiter, there probably weren't a lot of station then."], ["The times were different then. Many people bowled and I guess they watched it on TV.", "NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads.", "I believe it. Probably helps with strategy and maybe player safety. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!"], ["Oh wow that's cool. How was the concert?", "Great! He is very talented! Better than Kanye in my opinion. Kanye once did a snl skit mocking himself for interrupting award shows!", "I'm not a huge fan of Kanye music."], ["Oh that is so nice and convenient and free", "Yeah it is. DO you know why Michael Caine became an actor?", "I have no idea, how? DId tou know Patrick Stewart teaches masters classes in drama in the UK?"], ["yeah, but for engineering and science, it seems strange to me. Anyway, great chat!", "Ditto. Nice chatting with you!", "Have a great day!"], ["Have you seen Black Panther?", "No I haven't yet. Is it any good?", "I thought it was pretty good. The character is the richest superhero with an estimated 500 billion dollars."], ["I live in North East Ohio, I think fans around here would gladly swap the Packers records for the Browns.", "Yeah the Browns have had some tough times since I have been watching, much better season this one than last though.", "I guess there is always someone worse than yourself, just heard about the team that lost 222-0. That must have hurt."], ["Yeah I think so too. Gal Gadot who is the new wonder woman, actually served two years as a soldier.", "Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive. I heard she was really good in that movie as well.", "It's funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder woman. She thought she was trying out for cat woman"], ["Yea there is no rule against that as long as they qualify", "Yes. The game average is only 11 minutes of play anyways", "Yeah. Engineers make more than football players over their lifetime"], ["That kind of sucks, tickets tend to be really expensive and the game lasts for 3 hours, you would expect more than just 11 minutes of gameplay, really unfair.", "Yeah I know. Bowlers used to make more in the 60s than football players", "They did? I wonder what changed, bowling used to be really popular back in the day, it doesnt seem like a really popular sport now"], ["I know, honestly if it's a sport played with feet and a ball then i guess they have the right to call it that.", "That is true. In Hungary \"football\" is soccer.", "In parts of Africa too. in Australia Rugby is football."], ["Yup, that is why I do not go to these events.", "Well, obviously everyone else at the concert seemed to enjoy it so not to bad of a deal", "Are there any concerts coming up that sound fun?"], ["Yeah i'm sure your right. Can you believe top bowlers made more than top nfl players in the 60's?", "Did they really? That's shocking, I wonder why, maybe people didn't care about football as much back then. Also I'm sure bowling games have more than 11 minutes of game play.", "That's unbelievable. Almost as much as espn winning an Emmy. do you know what for?"], ["It was a nice way to spend an afternoon. i try to watch the playoffs and the superbowl. this year i didnt.", "I watched the superbowl. I thought it was terrible, but that may just be me. So boring this year.", "I think it was probably better the year before. there was a big comeback. this year it was a defensive battle. i wanted the underdog to win. too bad."], ["Hi there, do you watch the NFL?", "Yes I like to watch NFL games, I try to watch as many games as I can, what about you?", "Nice, yes me too. Did you know women can play too?"], ["That is pretty impressive, that is probably part of why the Patriots have been one of the most dominant teams recently.", "Yes - the Patriots at least made a better decision than his high school - since they let tom Brady play!", "I bet they are really regretting that decision now."], ["And their feet look all weird for some reason", "Well putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes will absorb the odor.", "That is something I have to try tonight"], ["Hi, do you like football?", "Soccer or American football, i like them both.", "I like them both too, I did not realize that the season lasts 17 weeks"], ["Yes that is true and I am glad they came up with that line because it makes watching the game much easier", "Definitely. Can you believe the former Patriots running back never fumbled the football his entire career?", "That is so amazing. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?"], ["Hello, Do you enjoy football?", "I do love football! How about you?", "Yes, I love to go to the games? What do you think of the Patriots?"], ["I meant breast cancer, lol! Did you know woman could play in the NFL if they wanted to and could play.", "They could possibly feel more comfortable in a pink locker room", "I agree, lol! Did you know also the saints cheerleaders need to leave a restaurant if the players come in, kind of sexist!"], ["Yes it was. Do you know anything about the FIFA World Cup?", "I don't know much about it. When the US competed in the first FIFA world cup in 1930, they got 3rd place.", "Yes they did. The city that is hosting the 2022 final does not exist yet."], ["Yes, although that duel thing seems like it should have been going on out in the cowboy west in the old days.", "Right? They must have kept the laws from way back in time lol", "Lots of curious things that are fun to learn about. It has been great chatting with you. Thanks!"], ["Yeah that's for sure. I really thought that players earned alot more money though.", "Maybe the MVP but an engineer will earn more money than the NFL player, I think soccer players are paid better", "Crazy to think that one team scored 222 points in a game once too."], ["that is crazy, I bet NFL makes more money now by a long shot, it was nice chatting with you!", "Yeah that is true, things have really changed. Same here.", "Good bye!"], ["Do you know if they have female players?", "Well, not in the NFL they dont but i'm sure they might have a womans league", "Did you know that the nfl has no rules against women? They could legally play if they met the requirements. What do you think?"], ["I would think so. Btw, nice chatting with you. Happy holiday", "Merry Christmas to you, and I'll leave you with this fun fact: The university of Iowa's locker room provided for visiting football players is completely painted pink!", "Thank you."], ["Hi friend, do you watch the NFL?", "Hey, I am a big fan of the NFL. How about you?", "I love watching the NFL, it may be my new religion. Did you know that Tom Brady has a book called the athletes bible?"], ["I'm originally from England so soccer is my thing, yes, a little rugby too. I've tried watching football on TV but it seems to go on forever, and is mostly replays of what has happened already.", "Yeah the average NFL game has 11 minutes of live gameplay, what do you think they could do to improve it ?", "Less commercials. I think it is mainly a cultural thing. If I grew up here my opinion might be different."], ["The third was JFK.", "I see. I wonder how rich president banana of Zimbabwe is haha. He may be the most loaded of all of them haha", "President Banana is an interesting name. Were you aware that the guest house is bigger than the white house?"], ["Then he got Randy Moss and blew that out of the water!", "Yup real talk! Tom Brady's wife makes double her husbands salary!", "I would be really happy if my wife made double what I make. That would be great!"], ["yeah, I'm one and I have a bunch of friends that do it. On average we make more than a football player!", "Oh that's awesome. And yep that is what I have heard did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players. Do you think we'll see one in our lifetime?", "I've heard that before, but I don't know if Americans can stomach seeing a woman getting injured on the field."], ["Do you wear a costume for halloween ever?", "my mom and dad used to dress me up in costumes for halloween sometimes. How about you?", "lol me too, I remember seeing pictures of some ridiculous costumes. I want to be a panda researcher though"], ["That's true. Do watch NFL football games?", "I sometimes watch. Usually about the Superbowl. What about you?", "I usually watch some games because my son really likes to watch football games."], ["I love Tom Hanks. I found it curious how the Lord of the Rings movies had huge losses despite being a success", "Wow, that's pretty surprising. Never know what's going to bring in the money huh? You know you'd figure anything Disney would be a sure hit but heard that their animated \"Treasure Planet\" was one of the most expensive box office", "Yes. And John Carter was a flop over here but broke box office records in Russia"], ["Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.", "Yes I do but not like ballet dancers. They can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.", "That is shocking. I used to date a ballet dancer actually. And I can confirm that they always have feet problems"], ["True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now.", "I find that pretty interesting!! Did you know when was the highest score in a football match ever?"], ["Me too, I'm surprised that Jupiter has radio storms they can be heard on AM radio.", "Yes. I wouldnt mind hearing those.", "I wonder what they sound like? What if it is actually aliens trying to talk with us?"], ["smart kid, took lots of ap tests in high school", "wow amazing. Brad Johnson is the only QB that threw himself a touchdown pass", "I did not even know such a thing is possible at all"], ["Me too. But I'm not sure what frequency it is. Kind of has me worried now!", "well maybe we will find out at some point. did you know we can grow a rib in 2-3 months", "No, that is shocking. How do they know that?"], ["No but I bet it's wild to see. Ha! Wonder if players are allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms while it's in play unlike regular soccer?", "Yeah I don't know it sounds more interesting to me than regular soccer though LOL, have you heard of the German player Mesut Ozil?", "I admire him because he donated his entire world cup bonus to pay for the surgeries of 23 different kids over in Brazil. I wish all athletes were like him!"], ["He was a very funny and interesting man. Something else that is funny is the University of Iowa painted the visiting locker room pink. I wonder what the visiting football teams thought about that.", "Yeah it was probably before pink became popular for professional football players to support breast cancer", "Do you watch a lot of football?"], ["Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went", "Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early"], ["Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive. I heard she was really good in that movie as well.", "It's funny that she did not know she was auditioning for wonder woman. She thought she was trying out for cat woman", "That is pretty funny, do you know what year the original wonder women made an appearance?"], ["Actually it was Georgia Tech against Cumberland, they beat them 222-0", "Hm. I figured that Tom Brady gave a biblical whooping to the Browns. Oh well. 222-0? Did Cumberland play with their cheerleaders or what?", "Hahah good point, I have no idea but what a defeat. Do you ever watch the ESPN?"], ["I do but i don't get the chance as much anymore. The patriots are on a role.", "Do you know how many teams are on the NFL?", "Wow that's a good question, how many?"], ["That is true. They produced a knock off lego once", "Wow, they have tried their hand on everything it seems, smart business people", "Very true. And they also own the Seattle Mariners. Good investment seems"], ["I'm surprised a building of that size has lasted so long", "I have no idea, but I am glad it survived. History should not be destroyed. Going back to football, the games apparently last only 11 minutes of active game", "I guess the players have other things to attend to. They are pretty busy. Sunday is a work day for them. I hope they are editing the Bible like that Jefferson fellow."], ["Yeah it cost a whooping $60 million, that is very expensive", "Yeah do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?", "Oh yeah the man is a legend, never fumbled the ball"], ["That makes sense. The NFL is using tracking chips on the players now.", "Yes they are and they are collecting many stats such as velocity and rotation and others", "Yeah. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?"], ["Yes I have, very funny movie. That was a classic right there. Thanks", "I have never seen it before, I think Bill Murray said it was comedy gold or something like that.", "I agree. Did you know that some of the very first silent movies out there were comedies?"], ["Yeah, wasn't he the guy who didn't ever fumble the ball? Thats a pretty incredible feat.", "That sure is, what a career. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "That is surprising, I never saw bowling as that popular. But engineers make more over a lifetime than football players. So there is some incentive to work hard in school."], ["Where did you usually commute from and to? Technology and innovations fly by year after year.", "I simply drove to the big city for about an hour and a half. Did you ever use the car radio?", "That sounds like my commute. I commute about that long one way for school and back home. Doesn't every car have a radio?"], ["I'm a huge football fan. How about yourself?", "I love football both college and NFL, do you have a favorite NFL team of the 32?", "I'm a New England Patriots fan and huge fan of Tom Brady how about you?"], ["Well apparently there is a president in Zimbabwe called president banana", "They could do a musical number. I think that many fans would follow.", "See I like that idea haha. Maybe they could make a lot of money so that Trump could be back into the top three richest presidents of all time"], ["I do too. The Saints should do better, if not for themselves, but for the good of the league.", "Yeah I agree with you on that. Do you know what the average actual time of gameplay is for an average NFL game?", "Something like 10 minutes, right? I think I heard that when they were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads of the players."], ["I hope so too. We need engineers more than we need athletes if we're going to have a good society.", "True! Although it is pretty cool that there isn't a rule that keeps women from playing. All they need to do it meet eligibility", "I guess in the future we might see a woman. Anyway, great chat! Have a great evening!"], ["I don't know honestly. We have some teams that have won state championships in the area but i don't ever go to the games.", "I would think it would be more interesting if you went to the actual school.", "I would think so too but there's a school in Allen, Texas that spent 60 million dollars to build a football stadium to seat 18,000 people."], ["Yep, that's how consistently good they have been. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are eating somewhere and an NFL player comes in, they have", "Thats rude. I wonder why?", "They probably don't want any PR problems from that. It's kind of weird that there is no women in the NFL. There is no written rules against female players."], ["Really, Id be interested to read it. It does sound a little extreme at some times.", "I agree lol, do you have a favorite team?", "I do, unfortunately I root for the Dolphins, it was a family thing."], ["I do not think I have heard of that, what is it? There is a radio station that turns solar energy into sounds", "WOw cool one. Have you ever listened to canadian radios?", "I have not actually, I just do not have the time I guess. Back to football, Kellan Moore is the only half handed QB in the NFL."], ["Good point. The ESPN once won an Emmy. Do you know what for?", "Hmm I do not know that, did not know they could qualify for any of those awards", "Yeah, well they got it for the superimposed yellow like"], ["Yes, I did, interesting. I think they owned alot of land.", "I believe so too. Up until 1805 the vice president was decided by who the runner up was in the presidential election. Interesting because there probably would have been 2 different opinions on issues of the time in the White", "Yes, that is interesting. Its good times have changed."], ["Yeah and after words maybe on a subconscious level. You know the highest scoring game of all time?", "Yeah it was 222-0. What a blow out!", "Yeah Georgia Tech was not playing around. I would have hated to be on the bus ride home to Cumberland."], ["Im doing great. How bout you.", "I'm good, thanks for asking. Do you like Tennis?", "I have never really sat down to watch it to be honest."], ["I love the NFL! I try to follow all 32 teams the best I can.", "Nice. I did not know the game season is 17 weeks. That is a long time and lots of games", "Yes. It seems to go fast. Each team plays a 16 game schedule."], ["It That is an interesting coincidence.", "Did you know the NFL has no rules against women playing?", "That's great! There should a team entirely of women!"], ["Hello, do you like television?", "I do. I love watching SNL - especially the weekend update.", "I love SNL. Did you know when South Park aired the Family Guy episode, they received flowers from the Simpsons crew?"], ["Yes but I guess that was because bowling was much more popular back then", "I guess so. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", "Yes that is 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland"], ["I think soccer players make less money than a basketball player. But as a whole soccer is watched by a lot of people more in comparison to basketball. That is just my opinion", "Yea basketball players are making upwards of 50 million a year thats crazy. I know overseas soccer is a huge sport. In There exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time.", "I never heard of such thing. How 3 teams can play on the field at the same time is a mind blowing. Hahaha"], ["Well the NFL tracks everything. They even have chips in shoulder pads and footballs for tracking so I am pretty sure they are accurate.", "I think its great that tech is being integrated into the game, cool stats indeed they should make devices to control the brain damage injuries", "You would think that an average NFL player who will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime would want to help their own health. The NFL is violent."], ["Are you a baseball fan? I'm not, so I am not surprised that the Women's World cup has higher ratings than the World Series.", "Soccer is the international sport. Women around the world will be keen on seeing the games. Not so much for baseball, I guess. I am not a big baseball fan, though I follow the playoffs.", "I'm not a sports person, I do like chess. Although, I didn't know it was invented in India."], ["No! Wow, that's awesome! Very smart and kind of them. I love animals more than a lot of people lol!", "It is a great thing they did! i wish the U.S. would do that!", "I do too, we have so many animals going extinct it would probably help a lot. They deserve to thrive and be safe too."], ["Yeah I guess it was a more popular game back then. Their coaches are the highest paid people", "Yeah no surprise there. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", "Hmmm no I do not, what is it. Did you hear about that giant stadium in Texas?"], ["Hi, do you like football?", "Hello, i love the NFL now thats a real sports league!", "Do you know if they have female players?"], ["Hello, do you watch NFL?", "Yes I tried to watch every nfl game. Do you like Tom Brady?", "I like him. I guess he is a book author now as well."], ["Hello there, do you watch the NFL?", "Hi, no I don't watch it. Do you?", "Yes me too from time to time. Curious fact, the U of Iowa visitor locker room is painted pink."], ["Are you a New England Patriots fan?", "lol no I am not. Did you know there is no written rule against female players? women are allowed to play football.", "And sorry, yes I watch football. I am not a fan of the Patriots either! lol I did know about the rule allowing female players. I'm surprised no females play tho"], ["That must be a nightmare for opposing teams! Wonder if that would have helped Cumberland when Georgia Tech set the highest score record when they beat them 222-0. Ha!", "Haha that is true! It's so surprising that an average engineer will make more in his life than an NFL or MLB player", "Agreed. I even wonder if engineers made more than the top bowlers of the 1960s since they actually made more than the top football players as well!"], ["Yeah, no kidding. Although the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetime earning of an NFL player.", "Plus fewer concussions too. I think it would be better for women to go into engineering.", "Yeah, no kidding! I know the cheerleaders on the Saints have to leave a restaurant if a team player is there."], ["Free with you, they should have had Snoop Dogg make a theme song for the game like he did for his son's high school football team LOL", "Interesting, do you play golf?", "I have tried to play golf but I'm not very good, it just takes so long to do all 18 holes I think"], ["For sure, did you know the NFL is the new religion", "I guess it is, many people watch it for sure.

Have a great day"], ["They cannot socialize or date either.", "Well that i agree with but forcing them to leaves a bit much to me.", "Yeah probably something happened for them to make that rule. Well, cant wait till the draft lol. Gotta run, nice talking to you."], ["That was a beautiful show, both in the writing and visually. It's probably the best bit of TV Sci-Fi since 1997.", "Yes I thought so too", "It's been nice chatting with you, but I'd better get back to work."], ["Well I hope the players get their degrees before going to the NFL. The lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player", "They could probably get tons of degrees after the NFL", "lol. The bible is the best selling book ever selling over 5 billion copies. I know that because every one has one."], ["I guess the football players chose the wrong sport then. They could have just gone bowling and make money. They could wear their helmet bowling too.", "Well things have changed now so that definitely is not the case. But engineers still make more than football players", "Engineers makes more than football players, but not for playing football. Engineers are good at engineering."], ["I agree. Though the earnings of an engineer over their life time are higher that the earnings of a football player. That makes me feel a little better.", "Until you think about retirement age. I'll take ten and out with millions over forty plus and out with millions. lol. What about you?", "Same here. I would rather a few years to make my millions."], ["Yes, I forget how football is usually soccer to most people", "Soccer is a popular sport around the world.

The only good thing about this model is that it pays for the lesser sports, like swimming and volleyball.", "Did you know Espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow first down line"], ["I think he is a pretty decent player. So was the former QB for Patriots, Benjarvus", "I think considering how many super bowl rings Brady had he is better than decent.", "Yeah that is true.

Do you?", "Yeah I do quite a bit I just have not managed to find that Jupiter station"], ["It is funny - bowling is a less athletic sport but they used to make twice as much as football players", "i think they now get paid more but not all of them", "yes that is true. Espn probably got more from winning an emmy for the creation of the virtual yellow line"], ["Yeah that is a wild fact, I guess the thing to do was to be a bowler in the 60's, that was the life!", "Sure would be a lot easier physically than football. Did you see espn won an emmy for creating that superimposed yellow line representing the first down?

On another topic, do you know anything about the Bible?"], ["Are you a Star Wars fan?", "Yes, star wars is great. i really like the original trilogy.", "Me too, that was the best out of all the movies, and basically the only ones I watched. It made George Lucas a billionaire"], ["I sure do. Did you know Jon Hamm taught drama in a high school?", "Cool. Did you ever watch the show House MD?", "Yeah and he even taught Ellie Kemper, she is so funny. Yeah I watch House"], ["Are you a Star Wars fan?", "yes, i really like the original trilogy.

That must have hurt."], ["Yeah I think so too. Gal Gadot who is the new wonder woman, actually served two years as a soldier.", "Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive.

I wonder what changed, bowling used to be really popular back in the day, it doesnt seem like a really popular sport now"], ["I know, honestly if it's a sport played with feet and a ball then i guess they have the right to call it that.", "That is true.

Can you believe top bowlers made more than top nfl players in the 60's?", "Did they really? That's shocking, I wonder why, maybe people didn't care about football as much back then.

I thought it was terrible, but that may just be me. So boring this year.", "I think it was probably better the year before. there was a big comeback. this year it was a defensive battle. i wanted the underdog to win. too bad."], ["Hi there, do you watch the NFL?", "Yes I like to watch NFL games, I try to watch as many games as I can, what about you?", "Nice, yes me too.

I really thought that players earned alot more money though.", "Maybe the MVP but an engineer will earn more money than the NFL player, I think soccer players are paid better", "Crazy to think that one team scored 222 points in a game once too."], ["that is crazy, I bet NFL makes more money now by a long shot, it was nice chatting with you!", "Yeah that is true, things have really changed. Same here.", "Good bye!"], ["Do you know if they have female players?", "Well, not in the NFL they dont but i'm sure they might have a womans league", "Did you know that the nfl has no rules against women?

I've tried watching football on TV but it seems to go on forever, and is mostly replays of what has happened already.", "Yeah the average NFL game has 11 minutes of live gameplay, what do you think they could do to improve it ?", "Less commercials. I think it is mainly a cultural thing. If I grew up here my opinion might be different."], ["The third was JFK.", "I see. I wonder how rich president banana of Zimbabwe is haha. He may be the most loaded of all of them haha", "President Banana is an interesting name.

On average we make more than a football player!", "Oh that's awesome. And yep that is what I have heard did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players.

Usually about the Superbowl. What about you?", "I usually watch some games because my son really likes to watch football games."], ["I love Tom Hanks. I found it curious how the Lord of the Rings movies had huge losses despite being a success", "Wow, that's pretty surprising. Never know what's going to bring in the money huh?

And John Carter was a flop over here but broke box office records in Russia"], ["Hey there my friend do you ever wear shoes.", "Yes I do but not like ballet dancers. They can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.", "That is shocking. I used to date a ballet dancer actually. And I can confirm that they always have feet problems"], ["True, I did not think about that, do you know how we are able to learn about interesting statistics like ball speed. ball rotation and players performance?", "Yeah that is actually pretty cool, they are using tracking chips on the shoulder pads of the players now.", "I find that pretty interesting!!

I wouldnt mind hearing those.", "I wonder what they sound like? What if it is actually aliens trying to talk with us?"], ["smart kid, took lots of ap tests in high school", "wow amazing. Brad Johnson is the only QB that threw himself a touchdown pass", "I did not even know such a thing is possible at all"], ["Me too. But I'm not sure what frequency it is. Kind of has me worried now!", "well maybe we will find out at some point. did you know we can grow a rib in 2-3 months", "No, that is shocking.

Wonder if players are allowed to touch the ball with their hands and arms while it's in play unlike regular soccer?", "Yeah I don't know it sounds more interesting to me than regular soccer though LOL, have you heard of the German player Mesut Ozil?", "I admire him because he donated his entire world cup bonus to pay for the surgeries of 23 different kids over in Brazil. I wish all athletes were like him!"], ["He was a very funny and interesting man. Something else that is funny is the University of Iowa painted the visiting locker room pink. I wonder what the visiting football teams thought about that.", "Yeah it was probably before pink became popular for professional football players to support breast cancer", "Do you watch a lot of football?"], ["Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?", "Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went", "Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early"], ["Yeah I think I have read that before, that is impressive.

I hope they are editing the Bible like that Jefferson fellow."], ["Yeah it cost a whooping $60 million, that is very expensive", "Yeah do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?", "Oh yeah the man is a legend, never fumbled the ball"], ["That makes sense.

Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?"], ["Yes I have, very funny movie. That was a classic right there. Thanks", "I have never seen it before, I think Bill Murray said it was comedy gold or something like that.", "I agree. Did you know that some of the very first silent movies out there were comedies?"], ["Yeah, wasn't he the guy who didn't ever fumble the ball? Thats a pretty incredible feat.", "That sure is, what a career. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s", "That is surprising, I never saw bowling as that popular. But engineers make more over a lifetime than football players. So there is some incentive to work hard in school."], ["Where did you usually commute from and to? Technology and innovations fly by year after year.", "I simply drove to the big city for about an hour and a half. Did you ever use the car radio?", "That sounds like my commute.

How about yourself?", "I love football both college and NFL, do you have a favorite NFL team of the 32?", "I'm a New England Patriots fan and huge fan of Tom Brady how about you?"], ["Well apparently there is a president in Zimbabwe called president banana", "They could do a musical number. I think that many fans would follow.", "See I like that idea haha. Maybe they could make a lot of money so that Trump could be back into the top three richest presidents of all time"], ["I do too. The Saints should do better, if not for themselves, but for the good of the league.", "Yeah I agree with you on that. Do you know what the average actual time of gameplay is for an average NFL game?", "Something like 10 minutes, right? I think I heard that when they were talking about the chips in the shoulder pads of the players."], ["I hope so too. We need engineers more than we need athletes if we're going to have a good society.", "True! Although it is pretty cool that there isn't a rule that keeps women from playing. All they need to do it meet eligibility", "I guess in the future we might see a woman. Anyway, great chat! Have a great evening!"], ["I don't know honestly. We have some teams that have won state championships in the area but i don't ever go to the games.", "I would think it would be more interesting if you went to the actual school.", "I would think so too but there's a school in Allen, Texas that spent 60 million dollars to build a football stadium to seat 18,000 people."], ["Yep, that's how consistently good they have been. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player. If they are eating somewhere and an NFL player comes in, they have", "Thats rude. I wonder why?", "They probably don't want any PR problems from that. It's kind of weird that there is no women in the NFL. There is no written rules against female players."], ["Really, Id be interested to read it. It does sound a little extreme at some times.", "I agree lol, do you have a favorite team?", "I do, unfortunately I root for the Dolphins, it was a family thing."], ["I do not think I have heard of that, what is it? There is a radio station that turns solar energy into sounds", "WOw cool one. Have you ever listened to canadian radios?", "I have not actually, I just do not have the time I guess. Back to football, Kellan Moore is the only half handed QB in the NFL."], ["Good point. The ESPN once won an Emmy. Do you know what for?", "Hmm I do not know that, did not know they could qualify for any of those awards", "Yeah, well they got it for the superimposed yellow like"], ["Yes, I did, interesting. I think they owned alot of land.", "I believe so too. Up until 1805 the vice president was decided by who the runner up was in the presidential election. Interesting because there probably would have been 2 different opinions on issues of the time in the White", "Yes, that is interesting. Its good times have changed."], ["Yeah and after words maybe on a subconscious level. You know the highest scoring game of all time?", "Yeah it was 222-0. What a blow out!", "Yeah Georgia Tech was not playing around. I would have hated to be on the bus ride home to Cumberland."], ["Im doing great. How bout you.", "I'm good, thanks for asking. Do you like Tennis?", "I have never really sat down to watch it to be honest."], ["I love the NFL! I try to follow all 32 teams the best I can.", "Nice. I did not know the game season is 17 weeks.

There should a team entirely of women!"], ["Hello, do you like television?", "I do. I love watching SNL - especially the weekend update.", "I love SNL. Did you know when South Park aired the Family Guy episode, they received flowers from the Simpsons crew?"], ["Yes but I guess that was because bowling was much more popular back then", "I guess so. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?", "Yes that is 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland"], ["I think soccer players make less money than a basketball player. But as a whole soccer is watched by a lot of people more in comparison to basketball. That is just my opinion", "Yea basketball players are making upwards of 50 million a year thats crazy. I know overseas soccer is a huge sport. In There exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time.", "I never heard of such thing. How 3 teams can play on the field at the same time is a mind blowing. Hahaha"], ["Well the NFL tracks everything. They even have chips in shoulder pads and footballs for tracking so I am pretty sure they are accurate.", "I think its great that tech is being integrated into the game, cool stats indeed they should make devices to control the brain damage injuries", "You would think that an average NFL player who will make less than an average engineer over his lifetime would want to help their own health. The NFL is violent."], ["Are you a baseball fan? I'm not, so I am not surprised that the Women's World cup has higher ratings than the World Series.", "Soccer is the international sport.

They deserve to thrive and be safe too."], ["Yeah I guess it was a more popular game back then. Their coaches are the highest paid people", "Yeah no surprise there.

Why?"], ["Somewhat, I know he's a rapper and was in Degrassi", "Nice. He graduated high school at the age of 25 in 2012.

But I suppose women would be better off financially by entering the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players.

Yes I am to both questions, I also really like Bill Belichick's coaching, I've read books and articles praising his leadership, you?", "And also it seems that being a football player may not be all it's cracked out to be. An engineer actually makes more in a lifetime!", "I'm so glad that invented that. Did you know that the NFL has tracking chips in players shoulder pads and the football?", "for sure. take care.", "He's actually a big speaker now and proponent of education and science he's a great dude", "Yes it was unless you were in britain where they rode side saddle. A lot of things are different there. They consider trousers to be underwear where america considers trousers to be pants.", "No, but it sounds kind of good. I like avocado and I like ice cream. I've heard of worse combinations.", "Yes indeed... I didn't realize that the NFL's average gameplay is only 11 minutes. That seems way low.", "Why must they paint it pink? Did they lose a bet?", "I am a fan - when I was a kid I wanted to be a pro player, because women are allowed, but it was not to be.", "Omg,  like 40% of the songs on the radio are Justin Bieber? That's not cool. Those poor Canadians.", "Do you live in a country has prime minister ?", "No - what team did he coach? I knew that Alex Smith was a brilliant quarterback who was working on a Masters degree when he was drafted", "Agreed! I wonder if the same rule would apply if they had female football players. After all, there's no rules forbidding females from playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements.", "It's mainly the fans that see Brady as a messiah and coach Belichick as some kind of deity. The say \"in Bill we trust\".", "Yea, the black swallower sounds lke a scary fish, it can eat prety twice it's length", "Yeah true. Do you know how long was the longest match in tennis?", "No problem. I think I'm going the other way and will listen to some jazz urban decadence!", "I wondered if the celebrity Anne Hathaway's name is inspired from that. I had no idea Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time! They would've seemed to live in different eras to me.", "I wonder what the nfl uses all that data for", "Wow, they didn't even score any points! I think my pride would be quite bruised if I was on the losing team.", "I should see it then. I didn't know Celine Dion did the theme for Beauty and the Beast.", "Hey, everything gets tracked, nowadays. Man, it seems like I've had nothing on my brain the last few weeks but football. How about you?", "I know, so strange. Did you know engineers make more money than NFL players in their lifetime?", "That is a fairly standard rule with NFL teams, the Washington Redskins Cheerleaders aren't allowed to fraternize with the players either.", "The NFL? The National Football League? I've heard of it. Is that still around?", "Yes cheerleaders should be able to continue eating in a restaurant when players come in", "Somebody lost their job over that one. Sometimes it's different by country. Despite \"john carter\" being considered a monumental flop for Disney, it actually broke box office records in Russia", "Do you know who to swim?", "Right, i think all sports player are over paid. They need to use some of that money to pay for universal health care in my opinion.", "I guess so - lol. Some birds fly from Alaska to Northern Mexico without sleeping when they are migrating.", "The same to you.", "I wonder what the nfl uses all that data for", "Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams. I am surprised Jefferson isnt among them, or at least with his special Bible.", "Yeah that's really interesting! It's crazy that a woman's never been nominated for the Oscar for it, too.", "I like to play but Im not good at it what about you?", "Denzel did it secretly, so I think he really wanted to help. Did you know that Tom Hanks refuses to play bad guys? I think he would be a fun bad guy.", "Oh wow i didnt know that,  thats cool lol I didnt know the raptors in the movie had humans inside suits lol", "It is the gauntlet thanos used to destroy half of all life in the universe. But it is the wrong hand in Thor so they think it might have not been the real one.", "He must have really believed in the project. Can you imagine if Bill Murray had gotten the role of Han Solo instead? It would feel like a completely different character", "Ya but there is so much going on in those dozen or so minutes espn even won an emmy for making the yellow first down line to help the audience digest the information easier", "yeah I will agree with that, for sure. they should have bought the rest when they had a chance", "When one thinks about the definition of the universe, one must include space and its contents, but also the dimension of time.", "I think that the secret to cures might be found in the humble zebrafish and its stripey hide.", "That is a good book. This new movie is done very well, especially the young actress, Storm, who plays Meg.", "I know the average engineer actually make more over a lifetime than an nfl player. Thats crazy.me", "While I am a fan of the franchise, I heard that it failed to gross more than 29million", "No, I've never heard of him to be honest.", "I didnt see it. Want to though", "I like him a lot. I also like Patrick Stewart -- he teaches master drama classes in the UK.", "He's been pretty good! All time great! Do you have a favorite team?", "That's an amazing personal history not many people have, really incredible. Gal Gadot thought that day she auditioned that she was trying for Catwoman. That is sort of funny. SHes just that good.", "anyway, did you know Bellichick is the winningest coach in post season football, 21 wins!", "im not a lebron fan !!! im hoping something is a little wrong with him haha", "Oh yeah. I think he makes quite a bit more in endorsments though", "I don't know if that would be tough or easy to do? lol", "So true! And no awards for that show since he seems to have a weird ability to not win any, deserved or not. Maybe working with Brad Pitt on Growing Pains jinxed him. Brad can't seem to do anything wrong.", "No I do not but I guess it was part of the cirriculum in elementary education prior to 1963", "Nice it sounds like a really fun hunt for Mickey items", "I did not see that one. That's a pretty bizarre rule.", "ya you're right, cool that Nasa named Gattaca as the most accurate sci fi film", "Yeah true. Do you know how long was the longest match in tennis?", "That's crazy! Japan was able to take a rock sample off an asteroid and return it back to earth", "Agreed! I wonder if the same rule would apply if they had female football players. After all, there's no rules forbidding females from playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements.", "Extremely sexist! !", "Wow, that is very impressive, sounds like he could go into any field that he wanted.", "not usually, did you know there are recipes for each nominee for best picture?", "Yes. Probably because of their longer careers I'm guessing. Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled one time during his career. Amazing!", "Wow the players have tracking chips embedded in their shoulder pads. Thats going a bit far isn't it?", "Yes. I thought the first was the best  out of the 4 that I saw", "It's great to watch with some beer. It's crazy Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 of the 1926 world series", "Can you believe what Sony paid for the rights to Spider-man in 1998?", "For sure, it is for calming their opponents, get the upper advantage, which is some psychology stuff.", "Um sure. i like football. i dont get much chance to watch these days. You?", "I'm not an avocado fan, other than guac, but it does sound interesting. Unlike Brady's \"athlete's bible\".", "Oh I love reddit.", "It is a good habit. Did you know that Apple became known as an apple because when translated into Latin, malus means apple and evil.", "That's pretty cool. Did you know there is actually a superhero called \"Normalman?\"", "Yea. They make ne not even want to watch anymore, its not even fun when they win no matter what in the super bowl. give us something different", "Either the winning team were that good or vice versa", "Interesting. Maybe the information isn't relayed in real time. It would be neat if there lights surrounding the end zone and when the chip broke the end zone the lights would flash or would be cheesy.", "I love it. Do you know some facts about it?", "Really? I should check out what the cost of a Netflix subscription costs.", "I do sometimes. Do you? Did you know that the company is over a 100 years old?", "No, I have not heard about that! How old was he?", "Yes it was for the superimposed yellow line. They deserve it very much", "Caitlyn Jenner when she was an accomplished athlete but the rest? She's made over $53M so far for what? Society seems to have it's priorities wrong.", "Yeah i couldn't watch the super bowl it was pretty boring.", "I just love that comedies generally have a happy ending. I love to smile and laugh.", "I never knew that engineers on average make more than nfl players in a lifetime, I guess NFL careers are pretty short", "Agreed. I wish I could have seen Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 back in 1916. That's the highest score ever in a football game. I can't imagine what that was like to see it!", "That is so bizarre to think that bowlers make more than football players! Especially with the Superbowl coming up on the first Sunday in February!", "He was a running back. He had a lot of carries too so that was amazing, it was so nice chatting with you!", "do you like the Avengers movies?", "Wow what a huge contrast, well deserving though he is the man behind the success! Stan Lee created Iron Man because he thought no one would like him!", "Pratt. I don't know. I know James Gunn wanted him so bad he was willing to use CGI to give him a fake six-pack.", "Hilarious! Do you like Michael Jackson?", "The Buffalo Bills are my favorite team, but I like watching others.", "Yeah, cats are cool. Do you own one?", "Oh nice! Can you believe there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay during the game?", "oh good lord yes I have, a whopping 0% on rotten tomatoes!", "Is there a specific policy change sought, or do you think it's too complex for anyone to hope for a clear resolution?", "I would love to hear that in my car. Sometimes a good drama on the way to work may motivate me to work better for the day. Did you hear about being able to hear jupiters storms on am radio?", "You have a good night too!", "No, but I do read the bible quite a bit and try to memorized certain verses, What about you?", "Perhaps, although her first film role was in a sports movie.", "That's really crazy. I wonder how much game time the 1916 game between Georgia tech and Cumberland had", "Interesting, who is the voice actor?", "That I couldn't tell ya. I'd hope not, as that would be a bit creepy, IMHO.", "rich people have their priorities. i could never afford to play golf, i think.", "More than one what?", "That's an interesting fact. Do you enjoy football and the nfl?", "Absolutely. Talk about degrading as well. But they also use tracking chips in shoulder pads to record every player move on a field, so the league has some issues.", "I agree loved his Tom vs Tom documentary. Have you seen it?", "Oh, ok. I guess the NFL is worried about losing footballs. I thought they were pretty easy to keep track of. The players need to be tracked? I guess they get around quite a bit, too.", "It's a fun show. Short on drama, decent for comedy. And lots of cameos by other actors.", "Do you know much about the Bible?", "Have you heard about Google duplex?", "Do you golf in the Chicago area? There are probably some neat courses there. Although, they take up a lot of land space and require a lot of water.", "I think that the storylines get played out and there isnt enough to keep it going. they use sfx to pad out the plot.", "Yes, that's reassuring! There's a library in California where you can borrow things like sewing machines that you might only use once. That's pretty cool!", "Yeah that is quite interesting. Pink Floyd have a recording studio that is in a grand houseboat", "No not really, my grandmother used to be really religious but Im not, I have read some verses of the sacred book though", "WOw that is interesting for a radio. Do you listen to radio dramas?", "Ah didnt know. Nintendo owns the Seattle Mariners. I didn't know that, did you? That's nuts.", "Yes they do! An average NFL game only has actually 11 minutes of gameplay.", "I do not even know how many zeroes are in that number , to be honest", "Do you like Drama tv shows or movies?", "Baseball is america's national pastime but it is very popular in Japan also. Many of the Japanese love baseball.", "Exactly! I wonder where the line ends too. I bet they have a similar rule for shoes, like you can't have shoes too dusty or something!", "Ice hockey is very interesting, but they are playing very aggressive", "Lol, Detective Comics comics, it is really redundant", "I would encourage her to be a New Orleans cheerleader. That way she would not be allowed to eat with the football players.", "You too, I think I'm gonna play some F-zero X, the first 60fps racing game", "Yes and he is the only player to have never fumbled the ball in his career", "It's amazing that they can use technology to analyze the game so precisely. Can you imagine if there were chips in golf balls to measure all of those movement metrics?", "Wow, I think George Lucas' wife got an oscar for editing for the films", "I would not want to see it! Maybe that's why no woman has met the requirements! Although, there is only 11 minutes worth of live play in a game.", "Haha, I bet the division is way more than twice the amount now, too. It's much better to be an engineer, these days, though.", "Could be, he considers football like his religion.", "yeah that is strange. do you know who plays wonder woman?", "I know some people take it too far. When you have fans it's amazing what you can sell to them. If Mr Brady sold avocado ice cream with his face on the front they'd think it was the best flavor ever.", "absolutely, especially with Geoff Emerick as a sound engineer", "No i never saw that game. That is ridiculous they should have a mercy rule or something. Who was that?", "Thanks you too! And yes Stanley is the man, even his wife did the voice of Madame web in the Spider-Man series back in 1994 which is cool", "Why the Redskins though? Isn't that a name to mock the American Indians?", "Yeah I still watch it on Netflix every now and then if I am bored, I have been re watching game of thrones as of late though.", "I think I was a little too young. I remember seeing re-runs ... at least the title song and her scratchy voice.", "Yea I did not know that, but read it in Factual Section2", "I haven't seen it either, but I want to. I saw Deadpool described himself as Ryan Reynolds crossed with a sharpee.", "Me too, I think the Marvel universe has great heroes and well movies has shown that to many.", "Yeah I think it has totally changed how people were able to watch and cheer, it makes so much of a difference.", "Since Nintendo owns the Mariners there;s even a 3DS app that allows you to order food direct to your seat. That would be awesome!", "No not at all. Do you enjoy the radio?", "I'm good, thanks for asking. Yes, I watch a little football. How about you?", "Time to listen to my radio", "That is odd! You would think that he would know the game inside out and be the best at it after all.", "There is a time of reckoning among the teams, as told in the Book of Revelation. I expect that the NFL will have to come to terms with the truth as told.", "Yes he thinks it was the aliens", "It originally meant \"doing something that is pretty much impossible\". That's very interesting because it's certainly not quite how we use it now.", "I've always wanted to visit there. Now I have a reason too! Well, nice chatting with you!", "Yeah, you should give it a try, I wonder what surprises will bring this years awards!", "I think they almost certainly will. It happened in NASCAR when Danica Patrick joined. Then after they get used to it, it will gradually get to be a normal thing. They will adapt to it.", "True. Did you hear of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?", "I used to take care of pit bulls but now I just have a cat. Do you?", "Wow that is pretty nuts - Disney World is a huge park! It is funny there is one character named Access who is owned by both Marvel and Dc who's only purpose is to keep the companies universes apart", "Hmm I am not sure, what is it?", "Yeah. It is tough because technology is ever evolving in sport and so the research is not there. I have to read a lot!", "Yeah true, unless they teach maybe?", "You too! !", "Waymo... I don't think I've heard about that one... is there a difference between those two ? Of course they compete... huge money are involved ;)", "Oh, I see. Yeah, but I often hear about how football stars or athletes mismanage their money. You think if the females were to play they'd make comparable salaries?", "I feel like so many sports stars start to go into business once they have wayyyyy too much money", "Hey there do you like the Seahawks by the way? I guess Richard Sherman is about to become a free agent", "That sounds pretty convenient! Did you know Elmo was the only non human to testify before US congress? I wonder what that was like..", "Do you have knowledge of how Tom Brady eats, exercises and rests?", "They've come a long way since 1932.", "I think it would be awesome to offer a stem class in the mechanics of space engineering. There are so many intricate things that people don't even know.", "True, that's alot of standing around time on the sidelines, for sure. You would think at least a kicker would be a female.", "NFL is very powerful. They have no competition.", "Not really, not that I know of but there some cool characters like Cable and Colossus.", "Maybe he didnt think his book had potential or was waiting to finish it, he died and then the piece of literature got discovered so its hard to tell now", "Hi do you like football?", "I played GB back in the 90s. I wasn't the best platform, but many people had the games.", "Speaking of voice work, the voice actor who played Jarvis in the Iron Man series has never actually seen the films.", "I can see why, as they have great games.", "Not really much anymore. I definitely wouldn't if I lived in Canada since it is required to have at least 40% of the music played in Canadian.", "For sure, I just remember leaving the theatres thinking what an awesome movie! Who would have guessed what was to come after that. Do you know Paul Bettany?", "Yes it is so sexist and it needs to go by now", "I believe they got sworn in on the Constitution, because they felt it their duty to serve the nation.", "I definitely do not. I had to take medical terminology in college and there was a lot of that in there but that's the extent of my knowledge.", "You too... thanks!", "I guess they're hoping it will make the other team feel silly while they're getting ready to play.", "The players need to be watched carefully. I figure it could help prevent injury.", "Yes! I love that he wants to know why we're here and what our purpose is!", "There's no way. I didn't realize you only have to be 13 to have an account", "Very true. I bet they have made clothes, it would be a huge market just to sell Tee shirts or even polo shirts like they wear in tennis.", "I agree! And semi-related, I've heard that the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink!", "Hmm good questions, I am not sure actually, why is that?", "Hmm interesting. Have you ever heard of foxhole radio and what they are?", "Most adults even have library cards!", "true, kinda like fantasy Congress where players draft members of congress and get points for legislative success. kinda nerdy if you ask me though.", "yes because of the ew factor when we found out they were siblings lol", "That's pretty cool. Did you know the man who assassinated Abraham Lincoln was named after the man who assassinated Julius Caesar?", "Hi do you like movies?", "hi how are you? are you a fan of bill shakespeare?", "I bet they do. They are probably made by engineers who make more money than players in their lifetime", "It's really interesting that radio waves also occur naturally.", "I did not know that 14 of the 25 largest stadium belong to college football", "That is pretty scary. It makes sense though because there is so much pressure.", "I just assumed the astronauts were all career fighter pilots before the Space Shuttle opened things up to a wider variety of people.", "Hi are you a fan of pianos?", "thats great! LOL. the tracking chips. can they track players off the field to make sure they dont go to the same restaurants as cheerleaders?", "Exactly I totally agree with that. We are free to decide what we choose.", "Yeah, the president's power to start wars is really scary. And there should be safeguards on the nuclear football too IMO.", "Can you believe there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay during a game?", "I guess football wasnt very popular back then lol", "The rights to a lot of those characters seems confusing. Disney does not own the rights to show \"big\" marvel characters  in theme parks east of the Mississippi", "They should to also check how their equipment is working. As athletes get bigger and faster they will need to adjust the equipment.", "No I don't, I have cable, mostly to watch and record live sports programs. I do find myself still flipping through channels sometimes though. I found this awesome 2 hr program about the beginnings of the American circus which was awesome!", "yea, Im 35 right now... I couldn't imagine sleeping 12 years of that. No wonder cats are considered lazy lol", "i love music. what kind of music do you like?", "Oh sure it is avocado and I am not surprised he eats very healthy all the time", "Do you know who Tom Brady is? he sure has an interesting way to see the sport.", "I don't even know who he is. Or if he should be weighing in on this", "I haven't, I think a lot of people haven't seen it is because it's broadcasted on Facebook Watch, do you use that feature of Facebook?", "The tech for viewing planets has had benefits in other areas. A critical step in creation of wi-fi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy", "I am probably more interested in all the innovation like World War II soldiers were able to construct a working radio with just a pencil and switchblade.", "You mean he has never even seen the films right? I heard that.", "Morena Baccarin from deadpool is gideon's voice in flash", "Possibly. The Bible has been used by many people for many things, not all of them good. The book is not the laiety.", "Yea that's pretty amazing, it takes a lot of talent to make a depressing poem inspiring when read backwards", "I did not know that! Good chatting with you!", "That's crazy! Did they just not have enough time to shoot? I think that's by Tomas Alfredson, no? He's had some decent movies before", "Yeah i get that but give me the 10-15 and i'm out not the 40-50, you know! So do you know how long a regular season last?", "The film I felt he really earned an Oscar for was Jerry Maguire. So memorable. Do you agree?", "This weekend. My favorite team, the Raven's, plan on Sunday.", "12 is his number that he wears for the Patriots.", "Speaking of superheros and all that.. did you know that Stan Lee (RIP) wrote 15 DC comics? I never knew he'd ever written for DC...", "That's incredible how they do that with the chips. They also have them in the footballs to track velocity, etc.", "Thats awesome! There are so few female directors!", "It really has. I have not followed it much but there are at least 1/2 dozen movies. its amazing Sony rejected buying the rights from Marvel for 25 million. They really missed an opportunity of a lifetime!", "Seems creepy to me. Big brother watching your every step...", "Yeah, well the average NFL player makes less than an engineer over the course of their life.", "Lol. But ya I hope they use it to lower the rate of physical injuries and concussions.", "Wow, I didn't know that either. It was great talking to you!", "That's cool I didn't know they were on Netflix.", "No, how?", "Wow! There is also a website where you can listen to thousands upon thousands of classical radio dramas. All for free!", "I agree. It dose not flow very well", "Yes he does have a lot of great qualities. I saw an interview where someone attempted to speak Portugese to him that did not speak it naturally. He chastised the other reporters for making fun of that person's attempt.", "Apparently people fantasy draft it too!", "I would have taken 5%! Can you imaine being that rich? I bet he's not doing HITs.", "Yea, the ending to Return of the Jedi was good but I found the other parts boring", "I know, that is really impressive! I bet only a few players have accomplished that, maybe he is the only one, did you know that ESPN won an emmy because of the creation of the first down line", "Hey, I'm doing good. How are you? Do you watch any sport like football or baseball?", "yes they are! Geez... wreck it ralph development started back in the 80s", "Yes! I love lego even though my last set came with a defective piece. The odds are so slim since only 18 out of every million are defective.", "Yeah Bret was something else. Still they didn't have any one like Benjarvus who never fumbled the ball his entire career.", "It cannot. Then everyone would do it if it did. The pink is cute but useless.", "I figure they would let that Jefferson one in the schools. Too bad.", "He probably has enough money to do whatever he wants", "Same here,  I am going to be looking at ingredients all the time now! Who thought it was a good idea to use crushed bugs in our food and why did it get approved, ugh", "I have read the Bible and have not found the answers to the questions that I had about football.", "Yeah I don't think you are alone there.

It probably has 16 minutes with 40 percent more plays. Nice chatting!", "Yeah, Leo is great. I hear he was in that sitcom called Growing Pains but I didn't catch it. What's Eating Gilbert Grape was a good one he was in, too.", "Most women have better things to do with their time than play a game, it is lucritive though, amazing how times change, in the 1960's top bowlers made more than football players.", "ya he did, and he also gave a speech, got shot in the chest, and then continued giving the speech haha", "I've never heard about that ! Good for ESPN ;) Hey, it was really nice chatting with You !", "Haha, not sure. It's interesting how much Americans love football now. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.", "Yes I do and unfortunately the Chiefs are playing The Pat's this sunday!", "I didn't know that. Yikes. I had fun chatting with you today! Hope the rest of your day is great!", "I heard that! I also heard they have a dung smearing scene that's been left out of those dinosaur movies. I can't say it was a mistake...", "Actually, I haven't but I have read the original novel by Madeleine L'Engle way back when I was in elementary school.", "I think that it is a very popular book. Many people have read it and tried to understand its secrets.", "It was. It was a running back by the name of Benjarvus Green Ellis.", "I love Tom Brady, his the best player of the NFL histoy in my opinion", "Yeah. The playoffs were nerve wrecking to me due to fumbles and such. Did you know there is a player who never fumbled the ball his whole career?", "True, I heard that too. I can't say because I havent seen the movie. But I do enjoy the Marvel Comic films.", "Oh, you're talking about that song Come Together, right? T", "I know. I feel like you learn that in middle school though.", "I guess we may never know. the PM of the UK during WWI is the great-grandfather of the actress Helena Bonham Carter. She was in the Harry Potter movies", "no they don't. One show did and that was the office. So amazing. ANother was thomas the train, ever see that one?", "LOL I did too.

He is one of the best, he embodies the Patriot Way with his prep and will to win.", "Hey! Do watch football?", "Oh that's cool. I used to work at a game store, so I have several old-school systems, including an Atari. We had a Commodore 64 in the store once, and I should've bought it when I had the chance. Sadly, I've never gotten to play one. I'm not very good at video games either. I guess I'm more of a collector than a serious gamer. They're a good way to relax when I have time. Also, I just found out that apparently playing Tetris can help people with addictions. I'm going to share that information with my roommate, who's a smoker. Unfortunately, I can't bring my Game Boy to work, so it probably can't help with my soda addiction.", "I wonder if they have any pictures of aliens on them, lol. Did you know bullets hit the white house?", "It probably doesn't matter. They can always do prequels, or sequels that bring the character back to life. I know so little I can't even guess.", "For sure. I'd rather wear the aloha shirt than a suit and tie any day.", "I would think money has a big factor and maybe proving something, but I imagine they must meet at least the physical requirements to withstand the impact of a 300 pound linebacker, you think female NFL players gear would be any different?", "Well based on the information I've read it doesn't look good.", "I have no idea. Madame Web? Don't know.", "Yes, those are serious crimes, and the involvement with Russia really bothers me. the cold war is not over.", "Yes it was 222-0 and Georgia Tech totally crushed Cumberland", "Oh yeah, that was a nasty one too. There have been way too many injuries this year", "That was really nice. You never hear about that type of altruism in pop culture. Usually just the bad stuff. That's really nice.", "big time, its almost seen as a punchline these days", "That's upsetting. I did hear about that. What really disgusts me is that is the cheerleader was there first and is already eating, she has to stop eating and leave. That makes me very angry. What's the point in that?", "I will have to look into him. I do not remember the name. Speaking of the Patriots, did you know that George RR Martin called them the Lannisters of the NFL? I don't see that as being a compliment ha ha.", "For sure, it would generate a lot of dispute so anyway do you like how Chris Pratt acts?", "Oh that is so cool, I would have never guessed that. I guess they were invented when those watches were around", "I haven't watched the film at all. I'll have to go check it out right now. Have a good day!", "You heard of the electronic music group The Thievery Corporation? theyre starting to blow up apparently", "I sometimes watch. Usually about the Superbowl.

The highest paid state employee in 39 of the 50 states coaches one of those two states at the college level", "Wow, that's an interesting pick of songs, it's much more modern of a rock song than I'd imagine.

Im just sick of it.", "I try to read a little every night before bed. A habit my grandma taught me when I was a kid. Do you?", "Yes and how does a cat become mayor and actually do anything for the town of Talkeetna?", "They are saying that an engineer has higher earnings over a lifetime of an NFL player, but I find that really hard to believe . The league minimum in 2019 is 495k.", "He may have, he seemed very talented. Can you play piano?", "Wow. Impressive. Never? I guess every defense must have been coming after him.

My friend was one in college", "that is crazy, I bet NFL makes more money now by a long shot, it was nice chatting with you!", "Yeah that is pretty short, crazy. Do you know what the highest score in a game was?", "ya he did, I should have followed in his footsteps, and I guess Jon Hamm taught the girl from the office, Erin, when he was a teacher, definitely didn't know that", "Wow that is super fast, how did he manage that?", "not sure, he must have done something. well they put a ban on declaring him a honorary citizen", "hahahaha  His debut studio album Thank Me Later was released in 2010 and debuted at number 1.", "Huh. I didn't know that.

Nice chatting with you.", "Yeah, that was the game. Crazy, right?", "I have difficulties understand your point. But football was not as popular as today in the 60s, then bowlers made 2x as much as footballers.", "Interesting, I'm not a huge fan of classic radio dramas.", "yup good to know haha, do you like the Saints?

Do you listen to radio dramas?", "That sounds pretty generous!", "Yeah it is one of the most influential books in history", "I would have to say out of the 42 teams in the NFL the Steelers are my favorite.", "Yes. Other teams just do things to be goofy - like iowa painting the visiting team's locker room pink!", "for sure, did you know the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at restaurants containing nfl players? I am rooting for the patriots also", "Yeah they are using them to track velocity, rotation and such. I hope they can use that data to make the game less dangerous", "Do you know what the highest score in a game has been so far?", "I love it too, you know that jazz trumpeters actually grow goatees because of the comfort they bring!", "I bet they do, do you ever watch ESPN?", "I don't think Smith will be the same even if he does make it back to the field after his gruesome injury.

Still is.", "Yes, he went as far as to use a razor to cut out the supernatural parts off of it", "Oh yeah, greasy hands, thin crust frozen pizza, and lots of high life beer.", "They do love football in Texas, too bad they don't care as much about education, an average engineer makes more in a lifetime than the average NFL player", "I didn't realize this but the NFL has no written rule against women playing as long as they meet the eligibility requirements", "That is interesting. I wonder how he was able to play QB? Admirable... Do you enjoy watching dramas when you aren't watching football?", "I don't even think Myspace exists anymore does it?", "Oh nice! Can you believe there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay during the game?", "Seriously! It was worth $104 billion by 2012!", "I watch it sometimes.

Do you have a favorite?", "Yeah, if that is the case I would like to visit such a historic place.", "I think it is because they don't see the need for a rule, it is not for gender equality , yet there could be a female kicker eventually.", "wow that is crazy. Did you know tht the nfl uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads to track their movements", "Is that high school football? Can't say I have watched that, at least not since I was in high school. Sometimes I watch Canadian football which is a little different then NFL.", "I don't know if that would be tough or easy to do? lol", "That is a good guide.

Are you familiar with Drake?", "That is many copies. I hope that the person who wrote it got some money. Often authors do not get paid well.", "Nice. Apparently Lincoln created the secret service the morning he was shot, I guess he should of created the day before", "From what I remember, all it would take is a pencil and razorblade, though I'm not sure how it would make sound", "I'm wondering about that... Seems short. I think it is true that the NFL has no rules against women playing.", "Yes! Why on earth would that be a rule? Do you think its a superstition thing? Makes no sense.", "Yeah exactly and it was part of the education system until late, like 1963", "I probably would, I just never think to watch them. I watched the first two or three installments of the Frank Miller Batman franchise.", "I know, it quite popular in the 1960s.", "Yeah. I think Marvel started in the 1930s or so.", "I bet there are some wild parties there. Diplomats, celebrities, Presidental mistresses, athletes.", "Crazy. Good thing they avoided him though, because they went on to make movies like Thor, Avengers, and Black Panther.", "i know right! This is funny, Dr. seuss's editor bet him $50 he couldnt write a book in 50 words or less... the editor lost the bet lol", "Didn't Lockheed Martin lose on somehow?", "Everyone in Finland has the right to an internet connection.", "lol why? Do they believe it may bring any benefits to Iowa?", "Asked politely? I would be upset if I were a cheerleader! Like I would lose all of my inhibitions and just hook up with a player at the restaurant. That's a little demeaning...", "Some of the Marvel ones, like Ironman 2 or 3, they have started to get repetitive to me.", "I have heard of it, is that somehow related to comedy", "Oh yeah, I remember that. It was founded as a card company in 1889.", "Right? Did you know they use tracking chips in the players pads?", "Yes! And I found it interesting that the marvel films are distributed by Walt Disney Pictures, but it makes sense!", "Are you a fan of superheroes?", "Yep thank you too, keep in mind Serena Williams is the first player ever, male or female, to achieve the career golden slam which is incredible", "Lol yeah they are Tom Brady is one hell of a quarterback", "It could be.

See you around.", "Do you have a favorite team?", "I've been to both. Disneyworld is more fun, but a lot bigger. A bit overwhelming in that way.", "it is boring, there is only about 11 minutes of actual gameply in any football game, that explains why I don't like them!", "Yeah the guy has already released 3 albums, wow", "It was 222-0, that is why it went down in history", "How times have changed. But even now, engineers still make more over their lifetime", "The guys is awesome and now also a book author. Did you hear about that?", "Still  you kind of have to go. If you want to be an engineer, at least one that has career earnings more then most football players.", "Yeah I think I have watched all of them lol Did you know there is one character that both marvel and dc own?", "What? That is insane! Lucky guy lol. So do you follow the NFL at all?", "I have read about a couple but overall I just don't think it's a good idea.", "And the NFL puts tracking chips in the players' equipment to track their every move. What woman would want a room full of men telling them that they watched their every mis-step, and they have proof that they were out of place? No thank you. Tracking the location of a ball, ok. Tracking the women on the field seems like stalking...", "I will read more about the space. Have a nice evening.

I don't blame him though, I kind of wish Peyton Manning stayed around for a while longer, I liked him.", "Yeah that is a good point. Did you hear they are using tracking chips on the players?", "Well I would have rather had been a bowler instead of a football player in the 60's", "I find that pretty interesting!! Did you know when was the highest score in a football match ever?", "I like the Broncos. Have you read the Indentured by Ben Strauss and Joe Nocera?", "I wasn't aware of that, actually. That's sad and unfair - almost as bad as the Saints cheerleaders not being allowed to dine in the same restaurant as the football players.", "That was a beautiful show, both in the writing and visually. It's probably the best bit of TV Sci-Fi since 1997.", "Yes, I was reading about the chips that they're using in shoulder pads. I hope the data they gather that way will be used to prevent injuries.", "Yes, you are right, I have lots of comics books, I am not a reader, I like them for the drawing of the characters.", "Yeah they must not have liked that.

At least have some kind of plan before hand so they aren't in the same restaurant. Guess they think its too much togetherness. lol", "Interesting. I prefer to watch tv. How about you?", "Yeah what a game. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy?", "I think it was a game georgia tech scored 222 points", "I don't know about that, since the phone was invented in the late 1800s, there were a few big cities at that time.", "Yes they take the average of devices as they more around", "Yes. He played all his role very well and multi talented person he is.", "I agree. It's not that big of a deal. Here's another interesting football fact, there are only 11 actual minutes of gameplay in an average NFL game.", "I know what Jefferson created his own version of it without the supernatural parts", "I know that it has sold over 5 billion copies. Amazing record there", "George was smart about merchandising. he got the rights for a song.", "Laurie made lots of money there, $700 000 per episode", "Yeah, he was clever. he knew the value of merchandising right. he traded away some cash for a huge bonanza.", "no. i didnt. that is wild", "Yeah that is nice.

Yeah, they are great in the warm months.", "NPR radio is pretty good, have you heard about the music genome project in pandora?", "Good question. I love the way they experimented with musical styles", "I don't think anything would have helped Cumberland that day. Probably only a freak hurricane.", "yea they do. I wonder why also. Did you ever watch pokemon?", "Not really. I'm some times curious when I hear people quote from it. I used to have to do it in school when I was a kid.", "Cannot blame them, engineers make more over their lifetime", "Oscar for editing. She helped shape the film too. A lot of plot points were her ideas.", "I think that is hilarious, I wonder who was in charge over there and said it was ok to do, I think it's cool.", "A Broadway production of Spider-man? That's an odd choice. Not very typical.", "Yeah. Have you heard the president of Indonesia is a pop star?", "Yeah if only Michael had not insisted on bringing his llama to the studio", "That is quite a few of them. Nice chat", "Yeah about them not being able to eat in the same place as the players?", "That was all I read about it. However, the math that describes orbiting one star is complex enough.

I heard am radios can pick up their radio waves, that would be spooky!", "It was good talking to you!", "Me neither, his only song gold digger was in the top ten songs of all time.", "Nice. Caine became an actor because all the pretty girls were in drama class", "You too. Take care.", "That's impressive. I always thought the richest was Tony Stark.", "That sounds awful, I wonder how many Cumberland fans were still in the stands when that game ended?", "That is pretty funny, do you know what year the original wonder women made an appearance?", "Yes they have longer careers too though so more time to make money", "Yeah football has really surpassed it now. But engineers still make more money over their lifetime.", "How many weeks are in the NFL's regular season?", "I haven't checked recently. Hey, i gotta go for now it was nice chatting with you. I hope you have  a great night.", "I think it was for creating the first down line! I guess it shows more people care about football now. Anyways it was nice talking to you, have a good day!", "Yeah, I tend to think low scoring games are boring.

Maybe some day...I also find it funny Brady was drafted in the 6th round in 2000.", "That's a good point that I never thought about. What is also interesting to me is that an NFL game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it that seems super low.", "why a panda researcher? what are the attractions and benefits of such a career?", "It's an interesting sport and a good shared interest for a parent and child. Thanks for the chat!", "And I loved John Carter. Never know, never know. I don't like Michael Bay movies.
