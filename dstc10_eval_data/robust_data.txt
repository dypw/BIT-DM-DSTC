do you like rap music__eou__i do but i cannot tolerate kanye west i adore tupac and think its interesting that the library of congress chose his music to be included because its culturally significant__eou__i agree kanyes old music was really good hes just out there just like how he thinks aids is a manmade disease__eou__
sounds strange i cant fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet im a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets anything with red eyes you can keep__eou__haha yep a snake doesnt seem very warm or comforting either i dont understand why people enjoy having them as pets and how do they find partners who accept it__eou__other people who like that stuff i guess haha apparently theodore roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and hyena i wonder if he played with them much__eou__well president of the united states i wonder if he had them in the white house did he have a stable for the bear out back__eou__
nice did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977 i remember going to the theater to see it__eou__no i did not my son went with his friends apparently star wars was dubbed in navajo in 2013__eou__there must have been a big enough market for them to do that they have the money to do it thats for sure just the box office alone the star wars franchise has brought in over 85 billion dollars__eou__20th century fox did not think that star wars was going to succeed do you know what happened to star wars licensing and merchandising rights__eou__
that makes sense i always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone__eou__yes fascinating fact tuna also hold a higher core temperature they are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers__eou__tuna can get quite large too its cool how big some fish get__eou__one more before we godid you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead__eou__

no that was chock full of interesting facts hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs interesting stuff__eou__never heard that one before lol there is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight__eou__i knew one of those in my fraternity in college i think i was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet__eou__yeah we all know that guy how about the loch ness monster being protected under the scottish 1912 protection of animals act creatures of the great deep are extraordinary the immortal jelly fish__eou__
i agree what kind of music do you like to listen to__eou__im a kid of the eighties and nineties i never really moved on from that alternative rock scene__eou__same here i think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh__eou__there has been the odd rap song that i like but for me its cultural im just not from the environment most rappers are and cant appreciate their point of view__eou__
no doubt do you know much about the planets or the universe__eou__i know a little bit ive heard that venus does not tilt__eou__that interesting uranus is different to it actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets__eou__thats really interesting ive also heard that jupiters moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun__eou__
i think that might be because nobody votes voter turn out hasnt gone higher than 62 in 100 years__eou__maybe some people figure theres no need to vote research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway__eou__we should just have people voted in by lottery thats what athens used to do__eou__it almost seems as if that is what we have now i think more states than just nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots__eou__
because an electron is part of matter the water you drink the chair you sit on saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread__eou__it makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big__eou__maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe __eou__i dont know but i am at the end of knowledge on this subject what do you think about the facts of comics i would have thought us invented them but its japan or uk__eou__

yes it helped him smooth out his dance moves__eou__nice do you like shakespeare__eou__yes i do do you know that he popularized many phrases__eou__yes like good riddance in my heart of hearts and such__eou__
what would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag__eou__i would look around to make sure mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with gimme back my child look__eou__lol yep you dont want to be around an angry tiger mom haha i guess they found one on the southern border in texas a bag with a baby tiger that is__eou__was it a smuggling thing__eou__
i wish i knew enough about the background to have an opinion but the last star wars i watched was episode iii when it came out on video i really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it__eou__same here like i also had forgotten that before his companionship with chewbacca hans solo was an imperial lieutenant__eou__yeah i dont remember that at all he definitely doesnt seem like the type__eou__indeed he doesnt but ive always liked chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog ha speaking of dogs i think its cool that dogs along with elephants are the only animals that understand pointing__eou__
lol yep you dont want to be around an angry tiger mom haha i guess they found one on the southern border in texas a bag with a baby tiger that is__eou__was it a smuggling thing__eou__yes i think so unfortunately the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately__eou__with 20 quintillion animals in this world why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one__eou__
i vaguely recall reading something in the star wars fictional universe where a young han solo stayed with chewbacca and his mom in their home__eou__thats so weird isnt it ha are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and chewbacca were secret rebel agents i kind of think its an interesting theory__eou__i wish i knew enough about the background to have an opinion but the last star wars i watched was episode iii when it came out on video i really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it__eou__same here like i also had forgotten that before his companionship with chewbacca hans solo was an imperial lieutenant__eou__
you must have esp i was going to tell you teh same thing i have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in asia than as pets in the us__eou__really thats awful to hear__eou__of roosevelts 20 pets two were a bear and hyena__eou__whoa cool i know he seemed to be quite the animal lover__eou__
i already looked up that jellyfish on my phone fascinating yes loch ness is protected and pets in boulder colorado are not owned but guarded interesting how different cultures handle that__eou__tell me about it apparently there are more us tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in asia__eou__yes that is sad in some ways too happy were keeping them alive probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today__eou__i agree germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionallyguaranteed rights__eou__
yes a seahorse wouldnt be very good for that purpose did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck__eou__i dont think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length__eou__that would freak me out but i bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication__eou__could be fish are cool like that i think its neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish__eou__
yes the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor related to domestication i had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads i wonder what causes that it doesnt seem to have any evolutionary reason to me__eou__sounds strange i cant fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet im a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets anything with red eyes you can keep__eou__haha yep a snake doesnt seem very warm or comforting either i dont understand why people enjoy having them as pets and how do they find partners who accept it__eou__other people who like that stuff i guess haha apparently theodore roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and hyena i wonder if he played with them much__eou__
i have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite__eou__dogs are my favorite also i hope to get another one in the future__eou__do you have any now i have two__eou__no i do not what kind do you have 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish__eou__
right me neither there were so many good choices of comics when i was growing up__eou__not where i lived if i want to read a comic book i had to go to the library but as i think about it tintin is a comic book so i was wrong i did read a lot of them when i was young but they were european__eou__mine all time favorite was bozo the clown books and tv both__eou__i did saw a lot of cartoons on tv but i dont think that considered as a comic book have a nice day__eou__
it almost seems as if that is what we have now i think more states than just nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots__eou__yeah hopefully well see some electoral reform soon hopefully we can see this will improve fairness__eou__speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the uk could vote until 1918__eou__nope but i did hear that astronauts can vote from space__eou__
i think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the dear amy section__eou__that is sad do you have pets the first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat__eou__yes i have a dog sounds like in the dear amy that they do everything tit for tat the cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat thats not necessarily fair though i dont think they seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future__eou__yeah thats a bit dramatic a cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile__eou__
no that is really sad poor tiger what happened to it why was it in a bag__eou__i guess it was being smuggled to the usa from mexico__eou__ya i dont like that that makes me mad do you have any pets i guess in japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen__eou__they really love their pets huh no i dont have any pets do you__eou__
i dont see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure__eou__yeah but only one for all the universe it does not seems logic __eou__there is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron__eou__because an electron is part of matter the water you drink the chair you sit on saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread__eou__
hi do you like fish__eou__yes i love fish do you__eou__yes me too some of them can eat prey twice their sizew__eou__
hello__eou__hello do you have a cat i see that some people can be allergic to them__eou__no i do not i am actually allergic to cats the first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat__eou__thats interesting and a little funny i had no idea of this but the cat is the most popular pet in the world did you know that__eou__
well ill have to watch that movie i just think its cool that hiccups are relics of when animals had both lungs and gills so next time you have the hiccups think about that lol__eou__does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to deevolve maybe that is what happened to the loch ness monster im glad she is a protected species hate to think someone might bag aunt matilda__eou__its funny that its protected by 1912 scottish law the protection of animals act hopefully that means that its a real animal lol but i doubt it__eou__yeah aunt matilda would make a better hag fish anyway or maybe a seahorse since they are the only fish with a neck__eou__
i dont know but i am at the end of knowledge on this subject what do you think about the facts of comics i would have thought us invented them but its japan or uk__eou__japan has a great printing history i am not surprised about this do you read comics books i have read a few but not about superheroes__eou__i used to in my childhood but not any more i used to love inspector gadget__eou__was inspect gadget a comics on paper or a cartoon on tv i was talking about what marvel is publishing__eou__

funny are you one for hats probably not a maga hat but hats in general__eou__i wear hats when im out hiking but that is about it how about you__eou__generally not im originally from the uk so i guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat but never really worn any type of hat__eou__it took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now i know wasnt that the most popular hat in the old west too__eou__
yes it does but it is not the same actor who did the other movies i dont think that matters too much__eou__i like their relationshop in the movies chewy is a very loyal friend__eou__in the canon chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons__eou__thats interesting i heard george rr martin had an illustration that chewie is based off of__eou__
in boulder colorado you cannot own a pet you can be their guardian though__eou__hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words do you like teddy roosevelt apparently he had over 20 pets or as they say in colorado guardians haha__eou__maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets shrug yeah teddy roosevelt is an interesting guy its unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger__eou__ya that makes me really sad what do you think about fish i had salmon for dinner so i do think theyre tasty haha__eou__
thats pretty wild marvel published a generic comic book in order to trademark the names superhero and supervillain that was pretty smart of them__eou__no doubt do you know much about the planets or the universe__eou__i know a little bit ive heard that venus does not tilt__eou__that interesting uranus is different to it actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets__eou__

i heard that too it was on the cover of one of his small stories it is a peculiar creature when you think about it__eou__i wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with martins help theres a giant fictional universe that could be filled__eou__would you like to see a film with chewbacca as the principal character __eou__i think it would be interesting there are also so many comic stories that could be told i just wonder how communication would work in such a movie__eou__

we should just have people voted in by lottery thats what athens used to do__eou__it almost seems as if that is what we have now i think more states than just nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots__eou__yeah hopefully well see some electoral reform soon hopefully we can see this will improve fairness__eou__speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the uk could vote until 1918__eou__

could be fish are cool like that i think its neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish__eou__i wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish__eou__that would be a good thing to know especially because some of them make good pets__eou__yep but i dont know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog__eou__
really thats awful to hear__eou__of roosevelts 20 pets two were a bear and hyena__eou__whoa cool i know he seemed to be quite the animal lover__eou__and there are more pets in japan than there are children under 15 you cant be a pets owner in boulder but you can be their guardian__eou__

funny i would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal__eou__i know they need to apply those genes to me also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck__eou__so seahorses are salt water right i guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin__eou__yes that would be true also true is that 84 of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish we need to study that fish too__eou__
there must have been a big enough market for them to do that they have the money to do it thats for sure just the box office alone the star wars franchise has brought in over 85 billion dollars__eou__20th century fox did not think that star wars was going to succeed do you know what happened to star wars licensing and merchandising rights__eou__didnt george lucas get them somehow__eou__yes because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to lucas__eou__
maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets shrug yeah teddy roosevelt is an interesting guy its unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger__eou__ya that makes me really sad what do you think about fish i had salmon for dinner so i do think theyre tasty haha__eou__haha funny i dont eat seafood my mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when i was little and i grew sick of it haha firstworldproblems__eou__haha ya well i am like the black swallower fish i could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because i love it__eou__
hey hows it going do you know what the first cloned animal was__eou__was it a sheep i heard the first cloned pet was a cat though its name was copy cat that is funny__eou__haha ya i like that what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia__eou__
yeah thats a bit dramatic a cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile__eou__allergies can be serious to people i understand his reserve of having a cat__eou__me too a pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a persons company protection or entertainment no one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house__eou__im sure she loves the pet but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance__eou__
did you know that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck__eou__freshwater fish only drink water through the skin via osmosis saltwater fish drink water through the mouth dolphins are friendly to human beings__eou__interesting they also have gills did you know that jellyfish are immortal__eou__yes fish is the important resources of human world wide for the commercial and subsistence fish hunts the fish in the wild fisheries__eou__

it must be pretty big then i wouldnt want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph__eou__i dont see that being a pleasant place its even 2000 degree weather that sounds like hell to me__eou__hahah thats a good way of putting it__eou__well i have to get to work i hope you have a good day it was nice chatting with you__eou__
some animals just should be domesticated that white patch if true is something to ponder__eou__yes indeed interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend that was an enjoyable conversation thanks and have a lovely weekend__eou__you as well__eou__thanks__eou__
sorry what i meant was she won the award about james earl jones i think he was only paid 7500 for his work that was not fair__eou__wow that sure doesnt i wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for darth vader on a different subjectdid you know that earths surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land__eou__i did not know the exact percentages thanks for the info__eou__on a sad note relating to those percentagesmore than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed__eou__
lol no not really i dont consider it to be music __eou__i mean i think it is definitely musicbut i agree not my type__eou__doesnt music needs melody __eou__lots of rap does have that__eou__
yeah thats wild i guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work__eou__agreed isnt it also funny james earl jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for darth vader i also cant believe he was only paid 7500 geez thats pocket change__eou__7500 is amazingly low i guess since darth vader was masked jones could just record everything at once in the studio__eou__agreed can you also believe that george lucas wife at the time marcia won an academy award for her editing on star wars and yet george lucas didnt win an academy award for directing that is just downright unbelievable__eou__
can you recommend any movies to watch__eou__do you like star wars the movie about hans solo just came out on netflix__eou__is that the one where its about a young han solo__eou__yeah it is the one so han solo is not played by harrison ford does it affect your opinion of the movie __eou__
thats really interesting ive also heard that jupiters moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun__eou__it must be pretty big then i wouldnt want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph__eou__i dont see that being a pleasant place its even 2000 degree weather that sounds like hell to me__eou__hahah thats a good way of putting it__eou__
all he has to do is talk and it happens haha i give him props though he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert however im sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too__eou__funny are you one for hats probably not a maga hat but hats in general__eou__i wear hats when im out hiking but that is about it how about you__eou__generally not im originally from the uk so i guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat but never really worn any type of hat__eou__
yeah did you know ballet dancers use a lot of shoes__eou__yes they go through 4 pairs in a single week__eou__yeah that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money__eou__yeah babies are also really good at dancing when they hear music__eou__
apparently there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal if you want to live forever you can look into being a jellyfish__eou__fascinating in japan there are more pets than there are children under 15__eou__teddy roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real teddy bear along with a hyena__eou__wow there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia__eou__
yeah i think that rule might be from before senators were elected they werent elected until 1913__eou__elections are a good and a bad thing ive heard somewhere that the people of ancient athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy__eou__i think that might be because nobody votes voter turn out hasnt gone higher than 62 in 100 years__eou__maybe some people figure theres no need to vote research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway__eou__
do you like dance__eou__yes i do did you know bruce lee was a cha cha dancer__eou__yes he even won a hardcore cha cha championship in 1958__eou__yeah did you know tupac was a ballet dancer__eou__
agreed they look so silly in my opinion a lot of rapping attire looks silly too but the rapper tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance__eou__im surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest speaking of rap do you know what eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper__eou__i didnt know that very interesting rappers also have some odd beliefs like kanye west who thinks aids is a manmade disease__eou__eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist kanye west is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas__eou__
i know a little bit ive heard that venus does not tilt__eou__that interesting uranus is different to it actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets__eou__thats really interesting ive also heard that jupiters moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun__eou__it must be pretty big then i wouldnt want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph__eou__
i wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with martins help theres a giant fictional universe that could be filled__eou__would you like to see a film with chewbacca as the principal character __eou__i think it would be interesting there are also so many comic stories that could be told i just wonder how communication would work in such a movie__eou__they would use subtitles and good storytelling like how hans solo seems to understand chewies intentions but not his words__eou__
yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like leias good luck kiss obi wans death etc she was truly a big influence__eou__i remember thinking just about everything in the prequels timeline was off based on the mental version of the past the ot led us to construct but id have to rewatch to nail it down__eou__yeah i would have to watch it as well so are you also a fan of chewbacca i love him i think its funny theres a bat species called the chewbacca bat thats hilarious__eou__i never felt strongly about chewbacca one way or the other tbh but ive got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like__eou__
i heard something but im not really following his offspring __eou__i saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k id want a whole lot more than that__eou__ok yes thats what i read and somebody needs to explain to me how using a surrogate really works__eou__simple explanation they take egg from mom sperm from dad put it together and then into another person__eou__
yeah but only one for all the universe it does not seems logic __eou__there is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron__eou__because an electron is part of matter the water you drink the chair you sit on saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread__eou__it makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big__eou__
yeah exactly i am sure they are cheaper one thing i bet they couldnt exploit is fish i think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal__eou__i had rememered hearing about that before immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck__eou__that is so funny i guess i never considered a seahorse a fish the black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large__eou__i guess they live up to their name then__eou__
that would be a good thing to know especially because some of them make good pets__eou__yep but i dont know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog__eou__probably not dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time__eou__hey did you know the first marine predator was the shark they developed in the silurian period__eou__
one more before we godid you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead__eou__yeah that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild__eou__very cool chatting with you did you know there are 6331 groups of genes they are common to all living animals__eou__it was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you__eou__
haha if freshwater fish can drink through its skin why dont you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita__eou__haha i wish i could drink through my skin and float in a margarita lol do you have any pets by the way__eou__too many to count weve had hamsters snakes scorpions lizards fish cats dogs chickens birdsour apartment is getting cramped__eou__haha thats a lot of animals we have a dog actually but i cant believe that there are more pet tigers in the usa than wild ones in asia a lot of people must have illegal pets here__eou__
yeah he was the mouse king in the nutcracker thats pretty cool i would definitely never have guessed that about him__eou__neither did i that is insane because tupac was a famous rapper__eou__he was indeed his music is even in the library of congress__eou__i didnt know this thanks for sharing__eou__
interesting they also have gills did you know that jellyfish are immortal__eou__yes fish is the important resources of human world wide for the commercial and subsistence fish hunts the fish in the wild fisheries__eou__what about cats do you like cats im a dog fan myself__eou__the cat is referred as domestic cat and wild cat they make our world very clean from rats__eou__

hmm good theory seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals__eou__well they are good at helping people adjust to new situations too__eou__yes like for elderly who are without companions__eou__or people with anxiety and depression or kids with autism__eou__
do you like rap music__eou__i do but i cannot tolerate kanye west i adore tupac and think its interesting that the library of congress chose his music to be included because its culturally significant__eou__i agree kanyes old music was really good hes just out there just like how he thinks aids is a manmade disease__eou__i just dont care for him i would have loved to have been in the courtroom the day a judge decided to give her ruling to eminem in rap style__eou__
hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words do you like teddy roosevelt apparently he had over 20 pets or as they say in colorado guardians haha__eou__maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets shrug yeah teddy roosevelt is an interesting guy its unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger__eou__ya that makes me really sad what do you think about fish i had salmon for dinner so i do think theyre tasty haha__eou__haha funny i dont eat seafood my mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when i was little and i grew sick of it haha firstworldproblems__eou__

other people who like that stuff i guess haha apparently theodore roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and hyena i wonder if he played with them much__eou__well president of the united states i wonder if he had them in the white house did he have a stable for the bear out back__eou__some animals just should be domesticated that white patch if true is something to ponder__eou__yes indeed interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend that was an enjoyable conversation thanks and have a lovely weekend__eou__
what candy is made in pennsylvania besides hershey__eou__theyve got milky way bars mars bars and even jelly beans__eou__wow thats way cooler than the fact that they didnt let women wear pants until 1993__eou__i know it is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor__eou__
that is crazy i also think its crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die aka its immortal__eou__does that mean they never get cancer or they get cancer forever you know 84 of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish but i have never seen a zebrafish with ms or parkinsons disease__eou__haha i havent seen it either maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease because black swallow fish can eat prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha__eou__haha if freshwater fish can drink through its skin why dont you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita__eou__
yes because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to lucas__eou__nice he scored then big time because the entire star wars franchise is estimated to 65 billion dollars__eou__20th century fox avoided to pay additional fee of only 500k to lucas they were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him someone got fired at the company ill bet__eou__you know it george lucas wife marcia won an academy award for editing the film__eou__

same here i think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh__eou__there has been the odd rap song that i like but for me its cultural im just not from the environment most rappers are and cant appreciate their point of view__eou__i agree too i cant believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha__eou__thats kind of cool i like it when people dont take themselves too seriously like when kanye made fun of himself on snl if only hed do it more__eou__
yes and they smile more when they hit the beat__eou__yeah they are much smarter than we give them credit for__eou__true did you know jackson had a patent on a dancing device__eou__yes it helped him smooth out his dance moves__eou__
i think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the dear amy section__eou__that is sad do you have pets the first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat__eou__yes i have a dog sounds like in the dear amy that they do everything tit for tat the cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat thats not necessarily fair though i dont think they seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future__eou__
yep but i dont know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog__eou__probably not dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time__eou__hey did you know the first marine predator was the shark they developed in the silurian period__eou__very interesting i wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then__eou__

yes like for elderly who are without companions__eou__or people with anxiety and depression or kids with autism__eou__yes a seahorse wouldnt be very good for that purpose did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck__eou__i dont think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length__eou__

elections are a good and a bad thing ive heard somewhere that the people of ancient athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy__eou__i think that might be because nobody votes voter turn out hasnt gone higher than 62 in 100 years__eou__maybe some people figure theres no need to vote research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway__eou__we should just have people voted in by lottery thats what athens used to do__eou__

thats so weird isnt it ha are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and chewbacca were secret rebel agents i kind of think its an interesting theory__eou__i wish i knew enough about the background to have an opinion but the last star wars i watched was episode iii when it came out on video i really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it__eou__same here like i also had forgotten that before his companionship with chewbacca hans solo was an imperial lieutenant__eou__yeah i dont remember that at all he definitely doesnt seem like the type__eou__

maybe some people figure theres no need to vote research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway__eou__we should just have people voted in by lottery thats what athens used to do__eou__it almost seems as if that is what we have now i think more states than just nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots__eou__yeah hopefully well see some electoral reform soon hopefully we can see this will improve fairness__eou__
that is interesting too i heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins__eou__they did that so they wouldnt be used as weapons smart move__eou__yeah it is id hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin__eou__that does sound like a painful way to die i do like the fact that kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once he does have a few redeeming qualities__eou__

i know they need to apply those genes to me also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck__eou__so seahorses are salt water right i guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin__eou__yes that would be true also true is that 84 of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish we need to study that fish too__eou__how odd do you think the loch ness monster is real it is a protected species__eou__
yeah their services are good im just not a fan of intrusive they can be on our personal lives__eou__google is leading the alphabet subsidiary and will continue to be the umbrella company for alphabet internet interest__eou__did you know google had hundreds of live goats to cut the grass in the past__eou__it is very interesting google provide chrome os which is a light weight os google provided a lot of hardware mainly in 2010 to 2015__eou__
would you like to see a film with chewbacca as the principal character __eou__i think it would be interesting there are also so many comic stories that could be told i just wonder how communication would work in such a movie__eou__they would use subtitles and good storytelling like how hans solo seems to understand chewies intentions but not his words__eou__yeah its like having a dog as a best friend but able to shoot things__eou__
yes did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck__eou__that is so cool and the males carry the young in that species__eou__yes and zebrafish are very interesting__eou__yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves__eou__

hey did you know the first marine predator was the shark they developed in the silurian period__eou__very interesting i wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then__eou__or have evolved into other species the shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer__eou__that makes sense i always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone__eou__
i read that and thought the same i wonder how similar the zebra fish is to humans can we use that in medical research__eou__if we can im sure it will be preventative or medication theres no money in cures i didnt realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it copy cat thats too funny__eou__yes the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor related to domestication i had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads i wonder what causes that it doesnt seem to have any evolutionary reason to me__eou__sounds strange i cant fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet im a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets anything with red eyes you can keep__eou__
thats funny its not even a proven species there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth__eou__did you ever hear of people being contacted due to dna matches you can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members__eou__that is pretty cool there are several companies offering dna testing and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy__eou__dna matches could be connected via social media__eou__
before google launched gmail that was the name of a free email service offered by garfields website that actually seems more fun__eou__i know now everytime i open gmail i think of garfield__eou__speaking of cats i would love to get a glow in the dark one they have those in south korea__eou__wow in japana and taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them__eou__
thats kind of cool i like it when people dont take themselves too seriously like when kanye made fun of himself on snl if only hed do it more__eou__all he has to do is talk and it happens haha i give him props though he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert however im sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too__eou__funny are you one for hats probably not a maga hat but hats in general__eou__i wear hats when im out hiking but that is about it how about you__eou__
yes that is what i was saying albeit i doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say__eou__i dont see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure__eou__yeah but only one for all the universe it does not seems logic __eou__there is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron__eou__

i heard that winning cha cha championships and everything__eou__yes that is amazing he won the hong kong chacha championship back in 1958 in fact__eou__i always just thought of him as a martial arts legend now he is a dance legend of sorts too__eou__yeah that is correct he was a fantastic martial artist did you know that tupac danced ballet in high school__eou__
haha funny i dont eat seafood my mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when i was little and i grew sick of it haha firstworldproblems__eou__haha ya well i am like the black swallower fish i could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because i love it__eou__funny i would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal__eou__i know they need to apply those genes to me also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck__eou__

its amazing and ever evolving__eou__yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away__eou__they are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see__eou__yes that is what i was saying albeit i doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say__eou__
